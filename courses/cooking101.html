  </section>

  <section class="tool-card">
    <h2>Module 1: Getting Started in the Kitchen</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn setup, recipe comprehension, and safety fundamentals.</p>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.1 — Kitchen Setup & Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand essential kitchen tools</li>
        <li>Organize workspace effectively</li>
        <li>Adopt efficient prep habits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Get familiar with your cooking environment — it’s your creative lab! Identify must-have tools like a chef’s knife, cutting board, skillets, and heatproof utensils. Organize zones for prep, cooking, and cleanup. Learn the “clean as you go” principle for smoother sessions. Master <em>mise en place</em> — ensuring everything is prepped and ready — for calm, focused cooking flow.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a handy “prep tray” for commonly used ingredients to speed up setup.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Reorganize your kitchen for better flow and photo-document your changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.2 — Understanding Recipes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Read recipes efficiently</li>
        <li>Learn cooking terminology</li>
        <li>Modify recipes confidently</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recipes are structured guides—but reading them well is a skill. Understand verbs like sauté, simmer, and dice. Prep ingredients before heating your pan. Learn the difference between metric and imperial units, and feel free to adapt recipes to your pantry and preferences. Experience builds intuition; this lesson helps you translate any recipe into delicious results.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before starting, read every instruction twice and pre-measure dry/wet ingredients separately.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Rephrase three online recipes into step‑by‑step instructions in your own words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.3 — Kitchen Safety & Hygiene</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Handle knives safely</li>
        <li>Prevent cross-contamination</li>
        <li>Maintain cleanliness and order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every confident cook practices safety first. Learn correct knife techniques and always cut away from your body. Designate separate boards for meats and vegetables. Keep your workspace clean and clutter-free, store perishables promptly, and disinfect surfaces after prep. Good habits prevent hazards and ensure food stays safe and delicious.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use non-slip mats under cutting boards for added stability.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create your own “Safe Kitchen Checklist” and keep it visible while cooking.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Module 2 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 2: Ingredients & Flavor Foundations</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Learn to select quality ingredients and build balanced, memorable flavors through taste awareness and technique.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.1 — Mastering Ingredients: Selection & Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and choose quality ingredients</li>
      <li>Recognize freshness and seasonality</li>
      <li>Practice proper storage to reduce waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your ingredients are the foundation of every dish. Quality begins at the market — choose vibrant colors, crisp textures, and aromatic produce. Seasonality enhances taste; tomatoes thrive in summer, root vegetables in winter. Fresh, seasonal items cost less and taste better. Smart storage prevents waste: keep herbs wrapped in damp towels, store onions and potatoes in cool dark spaces, and maintain safe refrigerator zones for meats. Respect ingredients by repurposing trimmings into stocks and sauces. A mindful cook values every component, ensuring nothing spoils before becoming delicious.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a “First In, First Out” container in your fridge to remind you which items to use next.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Plan a five‑day meal rotation using local, in‑season produce.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.2 — The Five Taste Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami</li>
      <li>Balance taste for harmony and depth</li>
      <li>Develop awareness through tasting and adjustment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every dish finds balance through taste. Salt highlights flavor, sweetness rounds edges, acid lifts, bitterness adds intrigue, and umami provides depth. Think of these as musical notes that must harmonize. Salt early to season evenly, not just at the end. Offset acidity with sweetness or fat; tame bitterness with salt or cream. Use umami from soy sauce, mushrooms, or Parmesan to create body. Train your palate by sampling as you go. Once you can identify what’s missing, you’ll cook by instinct — not measurement — and flavor will start to feel intuitive.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Taste in layers — a spoon before salting, after seasoning, and right before serving.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Make a base soup three ways: one more salty, one more sour, one fully balanced. Note which composition feels the most complete.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.3 — Building Flavor Through Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance flavor using cooking methods</li>
      <li>Layer herbs, spices, and aromatics</li>
      <li>Use texture and heat for depth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cooking technique turns raw ingredients into layered experiences. Browning triggers caramelization and Maillard reactions that deepen taste; deglazing captures fond — the delicious brown bits left behind. Build a foundation with aromatics like onions, garlic, and celery. Add herbs at precise times: woody ones early, delicate ones at the end. Layer texture to intrigue the senses — crisp toppings over creamy bases or a splash of acid to cut richness. Great cooks don’t add more salt for flavor; they build it through process, timing, and patience.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When sautéing aromatics, cook until they smell sweet rather than sharp — that’s when flavor peaks.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Stir‑fry vegetables three ways: raw aromatics, cooked first, and added last. Compare the aroma and flavor layers.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Module 3 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 3: Cooking Techniques & Tools Mastery</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Develop hands-on skills to cook with precision, confidence, and efficiency using the right tools and methods for every dish.</p>

  <!-- Lesson 3.1 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.1 — Understanding Heat: Your #1 Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how heat transforms food</li>
      <li>Differentiate between dry and moist heat methods</li>
      <li>Use temperature control for consistent results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Heat defines every cooking method—it's the invisible ingredient that turns raw ingredients into meals. Learn the difference between conduction, convection, and radiation. Recognize how dry heat methods (like roasting, baking, searing) build caramelization, while moist heat (like steaming, simmering) keeps food tender. The key is temperature control; understand the zones between medium-low and high heat, and adjust for the cookware you’re using. Instead of cooking “until done,” start thinking in terms of sensory cues—color, aroma, and texture. Once you master heat management, consistency follows every time you cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always preheat your pan for 2–3 minutes before adding oil; it prevents sticking and promotes even browning.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Cook the same protein twice—once over medium heat, once over high heat—and compare texture and moisture.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 3.2 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.2 — Essential Tools & Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn must-have kitchen tools and how to use them properly</li>
      <li>Sharpen skills in cutting, measuring, and mixing</li>
      <li>Maintain and care for your equipment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cooking efficiency depends on mastering your tools. Every chef has a small set they trust: a sharp chef's knife, sturdy cutting board, sauté pan, whisk, and accurate thermometer. Learn proper knife grip, claw technique for safety, and maintenance through honing and sharpening. Use measuring cups and scales for accuracy, especially in baking. Mixing tools like spatulas and tongs are your extensions of touch—treat them as part of your senses. Choose quality tools once, maintain them regularly, and they’ll serve for years. Confidence in tools breeds creativity and control in every meal.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Dull knives are more dangerous than sharp ones—keep an angle guide handy or use a honing rod weekly.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Practice cutting five ingredients into uniform shapes (dice, julienne, mince, slice, chiffonade) using safe technique.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 3.3 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.3 — Timing, Texture & Finishing Touches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master cooking and resting times</li>
      <li>Balance textures for elevated dining experiences</li>
      <li>Apply professional finishing techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great chefs know that timing elevates flavor. Learn the rhythm of cooking: start proteins first, then sides, finishing with garnishes while resting meats. Layer textures—crunch from toasting nuts, silkiness from sauces, brightness from herbs. Study the “carryover cooking” effect, where food continues to cook after leaving heat. Finishing touches—like drizzles of infused oil, lemon zest, or flaky salt—create restaurant‑level finesse at home. The difference between “good” and “excellent” often lies in patience, detail, and timing. Respect these final moments; they transform your plate into something memorable.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always rest proteins five minutes before slicing—this redistributes juices and locks in tenderness.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create one dish twice: once stopping immediately, and once with resting and garnish—taste the difference.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Module 4 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 4: Flavor Pairing & Seasoning Strategies</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Discover how ingredients interact, learn to balance seasoning, and craft harmonious flavors using herbs, spices, and textures.</p>

  <!-- Lesson 4.1 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.1 — The Science of Flavor Pairing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how ingredients complement each other</li>
      <li>Identify primary and supporting flavor notes</li>
      <li>Build pairings that enhance aroma and depth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Successful flavor pairing is about harmony—not just taste, but aroma, texture, and memory. Each ingredient carries chemical compounds that connect with others in surprising ways; for example, tomato and basil share aromatic molecules that amplify one another. Learn to identify “anchors” such as acid, fat, or salt that help other ingredients shine. Certain matches like apple + cheddar or lemon + garlic appear globally because they create both contrast and balance. Once you recognize these relationships, pairing becomes intuition—a creative process guided by curiosity rather than strict formulas.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When experimenting, combine one familiar ingredient with one new one; your palate will anchor naturally to the known.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Choose a single main ingredient (like chicken or mushroom) and create three unique pairings using different herbs or spices.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 4.2 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.2 — Seasoning Like a Chef</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master timing: when to season and why it matters</li>
      <li>Balance salt, acid, and fat for complete taste</li>
      <li>Layer seasonings for dynamic results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seasoning defines how flavor is delivered. Salt enhances; acid lifts; fat carries aroma. Add salt in stages—early to penetrate, mid-stage to balance, and at the end for brightness. Acids like vinegar or citrus bring life to heavy dishes. Fat stabilizes everything—whether butter, olive oil, or ghee—by coating the palate and extending flavor. Professional chefs taste repeatedly, adjusting micro‑amounts rather than measuring blindly. The secret isn’t just knowing *what* to use, but *when*: seasoning early builds depth, seasoning at service adds definition. With practice, you’ll feel when a spoonful “clicks.”</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a small ramekin of finishing salt beside the stove—it adds texture and sparkle just before plating.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Cook one dish unseasoned, then add salt and acid at different stages; note how each addition changes perception.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 4.3 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.3 — Herbs, Spices & Global Inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use herbs and spices thoughtfully, not just decoratively</li>
      <li>Contrast regional flavor profiles</li>
      <li>Develop your own seasoning “palette”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Herbs and spices tell stories of place and culture. Fresh herbs bring brightness; dried ones infuse slow, layered flavor. Learn how to toast spices to release essential oils and awaken aroma. Explore regions—Mediterranean balance (basil, oregano, garlic), Latin heat (cilantro, cumin, chili), or Asian depth (ginger, soy, sesame). Combine opposites—sweet spices like cinnamon with savory notes or a pinch of acid—to build complexity. Over time, build a small “signature seasoning” blend that reflects your style. The art of spice lies in restraint; use them to amplify, not hide, your ingredients.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For perfectly balanced spice blends, combine no more than five core elements—each should have a clear purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Design your own spice mix for roasted vegetables and test it against a store‑bought blend. Note which tastes fresher or bolder.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Module 5 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 5: Meal Planning & Efficiency Habits</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Master organization in the kitchen through smart planning, efficient prep, and systems that save time without sacrificing flavor.</p>

  <!-- Lesson 5.1 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.1 — The Art of Meal Planning</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to plan balanced weekly menus</li>
      <li>Streamline grocery shopping and budgeting</li>
      <li>Save time while maintaining variety</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meal planning transforms cooking from chaos to calm. Start by mapping your week realistically—busy nights need simple dishes, while free days invite creativity. Build plans around overlapping ingredients: roast extra vegetables or grains once, then repurpose them differently midweek. Keep a digital or handwritten rotation list to prevent boredom and food waste. Shopping smart begins with lists grouped by store sections and seasonal awareness. Thoughtful planning isn’t rigid—it’s flexible structure that supports your lifestyle and health goals while leaving room for spontaneous cravings.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a “master grocery list” template categorized by pantry, fridge, and freezer; update it before each trip.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Plan four dinners using shared base ingredients (like grains or proteins) to reduce waste and prep time.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 5.2 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.2 — Batch Cooking & Smart Prep</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use batch prep to save time during the week</li>
      <li>Store food safely for freshness and flavor</li>
      <li>Adapt recipes for multiple meals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Batch cooking means cooking once, eating often. Choose base ingredients—grains, proteins, sauces—that reappear in different forms throughout the week. For instance, roasted chicken becomes sandwiches, soups, or grain bowls. Label and date containers to track freshness; rotate by FIFO (First In, First Out). Freezers are your allies—portion soups and stews flat in bags for faster thawing. Proper prep supports creativity; with key elements ready, dinner turns into assembly rather than stress. Batch cooking balances convenience with homemade care, proving that busy schedules can still deliver nourishing meals.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Freeze sauces and pre‑cooked grains in ice cube trays—pop them out for quick single‑serve portions.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Batch cook three base ingredients this week and use them in at least two different meals each.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 5.3 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.3 — Creating Sustainable Kitchen Routines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Build lasting prep and clean-up habits</li>
      <li>Stay organized through small daily actions</li>
      <li>Balance effort with enjoyment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Efficiency grows from rhythm, not haste. Build routines that make cooking easier and more rewarding—empty the dishwasher before bed, set your workstation before every meal, and clean as you go. Simplify with tools that multitask and recipes that fit your energy level. Schedule one “prep and restock” day per week to chop vegetables, portion snacks, and refresh pantry basics. Link habits to triggers: brew morning coffee → check grocery staples, finish dinner → wipe counters and set tomorrow’s breakfast tools. Over time, discipline transforms into natural flow — the hallmark of a confident home cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> End every cooking session by resetting your workspace for “future you”; tomorrow’s cooking begins today.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a daily 15‑minute kitchen routine that includes prep, cleanup, and resetting for the next meal.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Module 6 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 6: Confidence & Creative Cooking Mastery</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Bring together all your skills to cook intuitively, think like a chef, and express creativity in every meal you make.</p>

  <!-- Lesson 6.1 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.1 — Cooking with Intuition</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop instinct through tasting and observation</li>
      <li>Trust your senses more than measurements</li>
      <li>Adjust recipes confidently in real time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Confidence in cooking blossoms when you trust intuition over instruction. Start by observing food cues—color, sound, aroma, and texture. Cooking is a dialogue; ingredients tell you what they need through these small signs. Learn to adjust seasoning gradually, notice how heat changes structure, and recognize doneness by feel. Recipes serve as frameworks, not strict laws—bend them until they fit your own rhythm. The more you cook, the better you’ll sense when something is right without relying on timers or measuring cups. True mastery isn’t repetition—it’s responsive awareness in every moment.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Taste every stage of cooking—the beginning, middle, and end—to train sensitivity to change.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Cook your favorite recipe without looking at exact measurements; rely only on sight, taste, and texture.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 6.2 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.2 — Creating Your Signature Dish</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Translate your personal preferences into a unique recipe</li>
      <li>Experiment with flavor pairings and plating</li>
      <li>Refine your dish through testing and feedback</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every confident cook has that one dish that represents them—balanced, personal, and expressive. Start by listing favorite ingredients and flavor profiles: comfort foods, travel memories, cultural inspirations. Combine them into a cohesive recipe; think in layers—base, body, brightness, and balance. Refine presentation for visual appeal; color contrast and placement heighten appetite. Test it repeatedly, adjusting texture and seasoning until it feels distinctly yours. Share the result proudly; a signature dish tells your story through taste. Once you’ve created it, you’ll understand what makes a recipe both personal and universal.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Photograph versions of your dish as you tweak ingredients—visual records help track evolution and improvement.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Develop and name your own signature dish using your strongest skill—from searing to seasoning symmetry.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 6.3 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.3 — Cooking Under Pressure & Problem Solving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay calm and focused during unexpected challenges</li>
      <li>Learn on-the-fly troubleshooting</li>
      <li>Transform mistakes into creativity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even professionals face burnt sauce, oversalted soup, or missing ingredients. The difference is composure. When problems arise, pause—never panic. Dilute excess salt with acid or liquid; rescue overcooked items by using texture contrast or sauce. Think resourcefulness: stale bread becomes croutons; extra herbs transform into pesto. Treat errors as experiments, not failures. Great food often comes from improvisation. With experience, you develop resilience—the ability to adapt smoothly and still deliver joy at the table. Cooking mastery isn’t perfection; it’s recovery with confidence and creativity intact.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Create a small “fix kit” of pantry lifesavers—citrus, broth, vinegar, and cream—to quickly rebalance meals.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Intentionally “ruin” a simple dish, then fix it using knowledge from this course—note what you learned in the process.</p>
