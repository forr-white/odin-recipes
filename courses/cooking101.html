  </section>

  <section class="tool-card">
    <h2>Module 1: Getting Started in the Kitchen</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn setup, recipe comprehension, and safety fundamentals.</p>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.1 — Kitchen Setup & Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand essential kitchen tools</li>
        <li>Organize workspace effectively</li>
        <li>Adopt efficient prep habits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Get familiar with your cooking environment — it’s your creative lab! Identify must-have tools like a chef’s knife, cutting board, skillets, and heatproof utensils. Organize zones for prep, cooking, and cleanup. Learn the “clean as you go” principle for smoother sessions. Master <em>mise en place</em> — ensuring everything is prepped and ready — for calm, focused cooking flow.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a handy “prep tray” for commonly used ingredients to speed up setup.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Reorganize your kitchen for better flow and photo-document your changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.2 — Understanding Recipes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Read recipes efficiently</li>
        <li>Learn cooking terminology</li>
        <li>Modify recipes confidently</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recipes are structured guides—but reading them well is a skill. Understand verbs like sauté, simmer, and dice. Prep ingredients before heating your pan. Learn the difference between metric and imperial units, and feel free to adapt recipes to your pantry and preferences. Experience builds intuition; this lesson helps you translate any recipe into delicious results.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before starting, read every instruction twice and pre-measure dry/wet ingredients separately.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Rephrase three online recipes into step‑by‑step instructions in your own words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.3 — Kitchen Safety & Hygiene</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Handle knives safely</li>
        <li>Prevent cross-contamination</li>
        <li>Maintain cleanliness and order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every confident cook practices safety first. Learn correct knife techniques and always cut away from your body. Designate separate boards for meats and vegetables. Keep your workspace clean and clutter-free, store perishables promptly, and disinfect surfaces after prep. Good habits prevent hazards and ensure food stays safe and delicious.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use non-slip mats under cutting boards for added stability.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create your own “Safe Kitchen Checklist” and keep it visible while cooking.</p>

  <!-- Module 2 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 2: Ingredients & Flavor Foundations</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Learn to select quality ingredients and build balanced, memorable flavors through taste awareness and technique.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.1 — Mastering Ingredients: Selection & Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and choose quality ingredients</li>
      <li>Recognize freshness and seasonality</li>
      <li>Practice proper storage to reduce waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your ingredients are the foundation of every dish. Quality begins at the market — choose vibrant colors, crisp textures, and aromatic produce. Seasonality enhances taste; tomatoes thrive in summer, root vegetables in winter. Fresh, seasonal items cost less and taste better. Smart storage prevents waste: keep herbs wrapped in damp towels, store onions and potatoes in cool dark spaces, and maintain safe refrigerator zones for meats. Respect ingredients by repurposing trimmings into stocks and sauces. A mindful cook values every component, ensuring nothing spoils before becoming delicious.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a “First In, First Out” container in your fridge to remind you which items to use next.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Plan a five‑day meal rotation using local, in‑season produce.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.2 — The Five Taste Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami</li>
      <li>Balance taste for harmony and depth</li>
      <li>Develop awareness through tasting and adjustment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every dish finds balance through taste. Salt highlights flavor, sweetness rounds edges, acid lifts, bitterness adds intrigue, and umami provides depth. Think of these as musical notes that must harmonize. Salt early to season evenly, not just at the end. Offset acidity with sweetness or fat; tame bitterness with salt or cream. Use umami from soy sauce, mushrooms, or Parmesan to create body. Train your palate by sampling as you go. Once you can identify what’s missing, you’ll cook by instinct — not measurement — and flavor will start to feel intuitive.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Taste in layers — a spoon before salting, after seasoning, and right before serving.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Make a base soup three ways: one more salty, one more sour, one fully balanced. Note which composition feels the most complete.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 2.3 — Building Flavor Through Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance flavor using cooking methods</li>
      <li>Layer herbs, spices, and aromatics</li>
      <li>Use texture and heat for depth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cooking technique turns raw ingredients into layered experiences. Browning triggers caramelization and Maillard reactions that deepen taste; deglazing captures fond — the delicious brown bits left behind. Build a foundation with aromatics like onions, garlic, and celery. Add herbs at precise times: woody ones early, delicate ones at the end. Layer texture to intrigue the senses — crisp toppings over creamy bases or a splash of acid to cut richness. Great cooks don’t add more salt for flavor; they build it through process, timing, and patience.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When sautéing aromatics, cook until they smell sweet rather than sharp — that’s when flavor peaks.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Stir‑fry vegetables three ways: raw aromatics, cooked first, and added last. Compare the aroma and flavor layers.</p>

<!-- Module 3 -->
<section class="tool-card">
  <h2>Module 3: Cooking Techniques & Tools Mastery</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Develop hands-on skills to cook with precision, confidence, and efficiency using the right tools and methods for every dish.</p>

  <!-- Lesson 3.1 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.1 — Understanding Heat: Your #1 Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how heat transforms food</li>
      <li>Differentiate between dry and moist heat methods</li>
      <li>Use temperature control for consistent results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Heat defines every cooking method—it's the invisible ingredient that turns raw ingredients into meals. Learn the difference between conduction, convection, and radiation. Recognize how dry heat methods (like roasting, baking, searing) build caramelization, while moist heat (like steaming, simmering) keeps food tender. The key is temperature control; understand the zones between medium-low and high heat, and adjust for the cookware you’re using. Instead of cooking “until done,” start thinking in terms of sensory cues—color, aroma, and texture. Once you master heat management, consistency follows every time you cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always preheat your pan for 2–3 minutes before adding oil; it prevents sticking and promotes even browning.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Cook the same protein twice—once over medium heat, once over high heat—and compare texture and moisture.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 3.2 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.2 — Essential Tools & Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn must-have kitchen tools and how to use them properly</li>
      <li>Sharpen skills in cutting, measuring, and mixing</li>
      <li>Maintain and care for your equipment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cooking efficiency depends on mastering your tools. Every chef has a small set they trust: a sharp chef's knife, sturdy cutting board, sauté pan, whisk, and accurate thermometer. Learn proper knife grip, claw technique for safety, and maintenance through honing and sharpening. Use measuring cups and scales for accuracy, especially in baking. Mixing tools like spatulas and tongs are your extensions of touch—treat them as part of your senses. Choose quality tools once, maintain them regularly, and they’ll serve for years. Confidence in tools breeds creativity and control in every meal.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Dull knives are more dangerous than sharp ones—keep an angle guide handy or use a honing rod weekly.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Practice cutting five ingredients into uniform shapes (dice, julienne, mince, slice, chiffonade) using safe technique.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lesson 3.3 -->
  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.3 — Timing, Texture & Finishing Touches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master cooking and resting times</li>
      <li>Balance textures for elevated dining experiences</li>
      <li>Apply professional finishing techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great chefs know that timing elevates flavor. Learn the rhythm of cooking: start proteins first, then sides, finishing with garnishes while resting meats. Layer textures—crunch from toasting nuts, silkiness from sauces, brightness from herbs. Study the “carryover cooking” effect, where food continues to cook after leaving heat. Finishing touches—like drizzles of infused oil, lemon zest, or flaky salt—create restaurant‑level finesse at home. The difference between “good” and “excellent” often lies in patience, detail, and timing. Respect these final moments; they transform your plate into something memorable.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always rest proteins five minutes before slicing—this redistributes juices and locks in tenderness.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create one dish twice: once stopping immediately, and once with resting and garnish—taste the difference.</p>
