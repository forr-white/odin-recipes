    <h1>🥯 Baking Basics – Lesson 3.2: Shaping & Proofing Perfection</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn to handle dough with precision and master proofing environments for beautiful structure, lift, and texture in every bake.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shape dough using techniques that maintain gluten tension and structure.</li>
      <li>Understand final proofing stages and how temperature affects rise.</li>
      <li>Refine visual and tactile cues to identify perfect proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Shaping is where science becomes art. Every touch affects how a loaf expands in the oven. 
      After bulk fermentation, gently deflate dough by pressing without tearing, then fold it toward itself to build surface tension. 
      This tight gluten “skin” helps hold shape and encourages even rise. Too little tension and dough spreads flat; too much and seams tear open during baking. 
      Proofing continues yeast’s quiet work — the final rise before baking that defines your bread’s height and texture. 
      Warmth accelerates fermentation (ideal 75–80 °F), while cooler conditions develop deeper flavor. In warm climates, reduce proofing time slightly or move the dough to a cooler spot.
      Perfect proof is judged by touch: poke the surface gently — it should spring back slowly but retain a small fingerprint.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humidity and draft control are vital for predictable results. Cover dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap to guard moisture and prevent skin formation. 
      For shaped rolls or pastries, consistency brings beauty: uniform size ensures even baking and color. 
      With each repetition, shaping and proofing become instinctual — your hands begin to feel readiness before your eyes confirm it. 
      From baguettes to brioche, the goal is control — a dance between fermentation, tension, and patience.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> If dough collapses slightly after proof, it’s over‑risen. Re‑shape gently, rest 15 minutes, then bake — you can often save it with timing and care.</p>
    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Shape two similar loaves — one with tight surface tension and one loosely formed. 
      Bake and compare crumb and volume. Record how shaping pressure and proof time changed the final appearance. 
      Mastering this balance transforms your bread from homemade to artisanal.
