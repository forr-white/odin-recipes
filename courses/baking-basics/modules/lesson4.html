    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Distinguish between doughs and batters based on hydration ratio and structure.</li>
      <li>Learn how gluten formation impacts texture and rise in different recipes.</li>
      <li>Adjust mixing and hydration to create ideal textures for breads, cakes, and pastries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Doughs and batters form the backbone of baking, yet they behave very differently. 
      A <strong>dough</strong> (like bread or pie crust) has a lower hydration percentage and solid structure, allowing it to be kneaded, rolled, or shaped. 
      It relies on gluten — the protein network formed when flour meets water — for elasticity and strength. 
      A <strong>batter</strong> (such as cake or pancake mix) contains more liquid, making it pourable, soft, and dependent on trapped air for lift.
      Understanding hydration is key: add water or milk gradually until texture feels right, not just measured right. 
      Over‑hydration leads to collapse, while under‑hydration causes cracking. 
      Gluten development also varies — knead bread doughs thoroughly, but stir muffins gently to stay tender. 
      The secret? Balance physical handling with mindful ingredients.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Proper mixing transforms raw components into structure: gluten builds foundation, fat adds lubrication, and sugar moderates toughness.  
      Once you understand how consistency connects to technique, every recipe becomes adaptable — firm for flatbreads, fluid for cakes, or somewhere between for quick breads. 
      Great bakers read cues: sheen, pull, stickiness. Dough tells its own story if you listen and feel before baking.  
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>If dough sticks to your hands more than to itself, add flour a tablespoon at a time; if it feels dry or stiff, mist lightly with water to restore balance.</p>
    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Prepare two recipes: a simple bread dough and a pancake batter. Compare their hydration, texture, and behavior when mixed and cooked. 
      Note how gluten development and moisture impact the final crumb. You’re not just baking — you’re reading your ingredients like a scientist and artist combined.
