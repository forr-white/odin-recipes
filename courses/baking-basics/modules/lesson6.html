    <h1>💧 Baking Basics – Lesson 2.3: Moisture Balance & Consistency Control</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Discover how to keep your baked goods tender, structured, and delicious through precise moisture management and batter consistency.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how hydration and fat impact texture, flavor, and shelf life.</li>
      <li>Understand the relationship between moisture, heat, and crumb structure.</li>
      <li>Practice techniques for judging batter consistency by sight and feel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Moisture balance is the heartbeat of baking. Too dry and baked goods crumble; too wet and they sink or stay gummy. 
      Ingredients work together to maintain equilibrium — flour absorbs moisture, fats trap and hold it, while sugar locks it in by attracting water molecules. 
      The art lies in proportions and timing: eggs hydrate with structure, liquids loosen texture, and temperatures control evaporation. 
      When ingredients are properly balanced, crumb stays soft and stable for days. Monitor consistency the same way a chef listens to sizzle — your batter should glide smoothly from a spoon, not run like water or clump like dough. 
      Atmospheric humidity often calls for small adjustments: reduce liquid slightly on muggy days and add a touch more on dry ones. Precision ensures perfection.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you mix, feel the texture change. A beautiful batter holds a slow ribbon when lifted, a dough springs back gently when pressed. 
      Moisture isn’t just a measurement — it’s sensory awareness. 
      The more you adjust intuitively, the more consistent your results become no matter the recipe. 
      Great bakers bridge science with instinct — knowing when a spoonful too much or too little transforms ordinary into exceptional.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> If cakes dry out quickly, brush layers with simple syrup before frosting — it locks in moisture without adding weight or sweetness.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Bake the same recipe twice on different days — one humid, one dry. 
      Adjust liquid by a tablespoon and compare texture, spread, and crumb.
      Record what you observe and build a “moisture map” for your kitchen to keep every future bake on point year‑round.
