    <h1>🌡️ Baking Basics – Lesson 5.2: Temperatures &amp; Troubleshooting Sweet Bakes</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Gain control over your oven and ingredients by understanding how temperature and timing influence success — and how to fix mistakes along the way.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how accurate temperatures influence rise, texture, and color development.</li>
      <li>Identify common issues — sunken cakes, burnt edges, dense crumb — and their causes.</li>
      <li>Apply practical fixes and preventative techniques for consistent baking results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Temperature is every baker’s invisible ingredient. Too high and cookies spread thin or brown prematurely; too low and cakes dry out before rising. 
      Most ovens vary by 15–25°F, so invest in an oven thermometer — the first step toward consistency. 
      In humid climates, ambient moisture can also affect baking time by slowing surface evaporation. 
      Always preheat fully and position racks at mid‑height for even airflow. 
      When problems appear, analyze clues: a sunken center signals under‑baked batter or too much liquid; 
      dry crumb hints at over‑baking or insufficient fat; hard crust often means excessive sugar or a weak oven seal. 
      Troubleshooting is about pattern recognition: track how specific recipes respond, and tweak one variable at a time. 
      Over time, your intuition becomes your thermometer.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> To salvage dry cake layers, brush with simple syrup (1 part water + 1 part sugar) or flavored liquor — it restores moisture and adds depth.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Bake a simple cake or cookie recipe twice: first at the suggested temperature and then 10°F lower.  
      Compare color, rise, and texture. Record patterns in a baking journal — this small experiment builds experience faster than any recipe tip alone.
      Mistakes won’t mean failure — they’re just lessons in disguise that make you a sharper, more confident baker.
