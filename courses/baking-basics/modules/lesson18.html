    <h1>🔥 Baking Basics – Lesson 6.3: Baking Under Pressure & Problem Solving</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Mistakes happen in every baker’s kitchen. Learn how to recover, adapt, and prevent them — because calm, quick thinking turns stress into skill.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay calm and focused under pressure to make smart baking decisions.</li>
      <li>Learn techniques to rescue common baking mishaps with grace and precision.</li>
      <li>Build resilience and confidence through practice and reflection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Every baker has faced failure — flat cakes, burnt cookies, split buttercream. The difference between frustration and mastery is reaction.  
      When mistakes strike, pause before you panic. Observation restores control. Check environmental factors: oven temperature, humidity, timing or ingredient substitutes.  
      If a cake sinks, repurpose it into a trifle or cake pops. Too-thin frosting? Add powdered sugar a tablespoon at a time. Burnt edges? Trim and dress with ganache — gloss hides flaws.  
      The most important step is learning why it happened and how to adjust. Baking is chemistry with emotion — you control neither without patience.  
      Confidence builds each time you recover gracefully and record your solution for next time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under pressure, organization is your anchor. Set out ingredients early, double‑check measurements, and create backup space for cooling or cleanup.  
      Keep a “baker’s rescue kit” at hand — a spatula, powdered sugar, cream or milk for corrections, and lemon juice to brighten flavors gone flat.  
      Remember that no situation is a failure if you use it to improve process. Professional bakers don’t avoid mistakes; they reverse them on the fly and move forward with composure.  
      You’re building that same mindset — poise under heat and precision under pressure.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Keep unsalted crackers or dry bread near — they absorb a small amount of smoke or burnt aroma from an accidental overbake without affecting flavor.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Intentionally create a controlled “mistake.” Overbake a batch of muffins or break a frosting emulsion, then rescue it using tools from this lesson.  
      Record each step you took to fix the issue and note how you stayed calm under pressure.  
      You’re not learning to avoid problems — you’re learning to solve them like a true baker.
