    <h1>🍞 Baking Basics – Lesson 1.1: Baking Tools & Workspace Setup</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Begin your baking journey by mastering precision tools, kitchen organization, and temperature consistency — the foundations of every successful bake.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and understand the purpose of essential baking tools.</li>
      <li>Organize a functional workspace that supports accuracy and flow.</li>
      <li>Maintain oven calibration, cleanliness, and safety for perfect results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Baking success begins long before the oven preheats. Equip your kitchen with the tools of the trade:  
      a reliable digital scale for accurate measurements, a stand or hand mixer for consistent textures,  
      heatproof silicone spatulas for control, and sturdy mixing bowls of various sizes for efficient workflow.  
      Organization is your silent assistant — keep dry ingredients, measuring tools, and mise en place ingredients in designated areas.  
      Always pre‑check oven temperature using an independent thermometer; most built‑in gauges deviate by several degrees, affecting rise and color.  
      Clean as you go to maintain focus and safety. A tidy workspace doesn’t just look professional—it prevents missed ingredients, spills, and stress.  
      With the right setup, precision becomes second nature and creativity feels effortless.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Keep your baking tools stored together on a rolling cart or drawer system to save setup time and streamline baking days.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Reorganize your baking workspace for flow and functionality.  
      Label ingredient containers, calibrate your oven with a thermometer, and arrange tools so nothing interrupts your baking process.
      Snap a before-and-after photo to see how strategic organization boosts confidence and performance in the kitchen.
