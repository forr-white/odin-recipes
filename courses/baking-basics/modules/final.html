    <h1>🎉 Baking Basics Final Challenge & Completion</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Congratulations — you’ve reached the final step of Baking Basics! Now it’s time to demonstrate everything you’ve learned in a creative conclusion to your baking journey.</p>

    <h3>Final Challenge Overview</h3>
    <p>
      You’ve worked through six modules covering ingredients, techniques, flavor, and presentation. 
      This final challenge brings it all together. Your goal is to design and bake a multi‑component creation that highlights your skills, confidence, and unique style.
      Think of it as your graduation bake — something that tells the story of your journey from novice to confident baker.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenge Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan Your Bake:</strong> Sketch ideas for a signature dessert or bread that combines two or more techniques you’ve mastered.</li>
      <li><strong>Prep & Balance:</strong> Plan flavors, textures, and timing for each component — the goal is harmony in every bite.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake with Confidence:</strong> Trust your instincts and adjust as you go — you know more than you think!</li>
      <li><strong>Plate & Present:</strong> Arrange with intention — color, contrast, and structure tell your story before anyone tastes it.</li>
      <li><strong>Share & Reflect:</strong> Invite friends or family to taste and offer feedback. Document your process with notes and photos to track your growth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Take a moment to appreciate your progress — you started by learning tools and measurement, and now you’re baking with creative freedom. 
      Continue practicing techniques from Baking Basics and explore new recipes that challenge your skills. 
      Remember to test ideas methodically and celebrate each success — big or small. Growth in baking is like bread rising: steady, patient, and beautiful to watch.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Create a digital baking portfolio that includes photos, recipes, and notes from this course — you can use it to track your progress or even share with future clients.</p>
