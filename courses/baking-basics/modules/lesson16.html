    <h1>🎨 Baking Basics – Lesson 6.1: Advanced Baking Confidence &amp; Creative Freedom</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">You’ve mastered technique—now learn to trust your sense of taste, texture, and timing to bake intuitively and joyfully.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop instinct for adjusting recipes based on texture, smell, and look.</li>
      <li>Move from static recipes to creative variations with confidence.</li>
      <li>Balance risk and control — the core of creative baking success.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      The hallmark of an accomplished baker is intuition—the ability to sense when dough is ready, when a cake has risen enough, or when a flavor pairing will sing. 
      You’ve already learned precision; now comes interpretation. Feel textures with your hands, smell progress through caramelization, and listen for the rhythm of your oven’s heartbeat. 
      Watch batter flow off a spoon to gauge moisture; feel pastry between fingertips to sense gluten tension. 
      Replace measurement anxiety with mindful feedback. With changing humidity, adapt on instinct: add a tablespoon more flour on muggy days or bake a minute less when the air feels dry.
      Confidence is earned by observation—every batch adds to your internal cookbook. True freedom in baking begins when you trust yourself more than the recipe.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a “Baking Discovery Journal” to note what you adjusted and why. Over time, these logs become a personal recipe library tailored to your kitchen and climate.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Choose a familiar bake (like muffins or cookies) and tweak one variable: a new spice, different flour, longer rest, or lower temperature.
      Record results and flavor differences. Iterate three times, refining until it becomes your own creation. Celebrate the moment you realize recipes are suggestions—not limitations.
