    <h1>🥖 Baking Basics – Lesson 2.2: Gluten Control & Texture Techniques</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn how gluten development shapes texture — and how flour choice, mixing, and resting work together for perfect consistency in every bake.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how gluten forms and why managing it is essential for texture control.</li>
      <li>Discover how flour protein levels, fat, and technique influence gluten strength.</li>
      <li>Practice mixing, kneading, and resting strategies for different baked goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Gluten is both hero and villain in baking — the elastic thread that gives bread its chew yet can ruin a tender cake. 
      It forms when wheat proteins *gliadin* and *glutenin* combine with water and movement. 
      The more you knead or stir, the stronger this network becomes. 
      In breads and pizza dough, that elasticity is good — it traps gas and creates airy structure.  
      In pastries and muffins, too much gluten means toughness. 
      Adjusting gluten strength begins with flour selection: bread flour (12–13% protein) builds elasticity, while cake flour (6–8%) stays delicate. 
      Fat weakens gluten by coating strands — this is why pie crusts “melt” instead of chew. 
      Resting doughs relaxes these strands, improving workability and texture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Achieving control means reading the dough’s language.  
      If dough feels rubbery, rest it. If it tears, knead it gently to wake gluten.  
      Bake with intention: create tension in loaves for good oven spring, or break it for flakiness in pastries.  
      Gluten isn’t the enemy — it’s structure waiting for direction.  
      Learning how to tame it is one of the baker’s greatest superpowers.  
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice to pie dough to slightly weaken gluten formation — it helps keep crusts extra tender and flaky.</p>
    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Make two doughs with the same recipe: one mixed and kneaded briefly, the other for several minutes.
      Compare texture, stretch, and crumb after resting and baking.
      Observe how gluten control transforms chewiness into softness — learning when to stop is the real secret behind perfect texture.
