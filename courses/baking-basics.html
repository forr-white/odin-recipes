    <h2>Module 1: The Foundations of Baking</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn how accuracy, ingredients, and environment determine your success in baking.</p>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.1 — The Baking Mindset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the difference between cooking and baking</li>
        <li>Appreciate precision and patience</li>
        <li>Prep your space for organization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Baking is deliberate chemistry wrapped in creativity. Unlike stove-top cooking, where taste adjustments happen mid-recipe, baking rewards structure. It’s the art of following ratios and technique while expressing yourself through flavors and presentation. Start by establishing workspace order—measure ingredients before mixing (mise en place) and read the entire recipe in advance. Temperature consistency—both room and ingredient—is vital. Treat baking as meditation: steady pace, clean tools, and attention to detail.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Chill your mixing bowl and beaters before whipping cream to increase volume and stability.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Organize your counter for “baker’s flow” and bake a simple cookie recipe twice—once rushed, once methodical. Compare results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.2 — Baking Ingredients 101</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify core ingredient families</li>
        <li>Know roles of leaveners and fats</li>
        <li>Recognize substitutions and allergies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flour creates body; fat provides tenderness; sugar balances moisture and structure. Eggs bind and add richness. Leaveners—yeast, baking soda, baking powder—introduce lift through gas. Salt enhances everything. Learn protein levels: bread flour = strength, cake flour = lightness. Butter vs oil affects crumb, mouthfeel, and flavor. Before baking, bring cold items to room temperature unless otherwise noted; temperature shock can ruin texture. Understanding why ingredients behave the way they do makes you precise and versatile as a baker.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Weigh ingredients on a digital scale for consistency—especially flour, which packs differently every time.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake one recipe twice—once using cup measurements, once by weight. Compare texture differences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 1.3 — Measuring & Preparation Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use proper measuring tools</li>
        <li>Avoid mixing errors</li>
        <li>Control oven environment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bakers measure with scientific accuracy. Use dry cups for flour and sugar, liquid cups for milk and oil, and spoons for smaller volumes. Never scoop flour directly—spoon it in and level off. Don’t overbeat once flour joins the wet ingredients; developed gluten creates toughness. Preheat your oven early and use an internal thermometer for reliability—factory settings can fluctuate by 25°F. Rotate trays mid-bake for even results. Consistency begins long before your dough hits the heat.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Clean as you go and reset your station between batches to stay error-free and efficient.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake muffins twice—once without rotating, once halfway through. Compare color and rise.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="tool-card" id="module2">
    <h2>Module 2: Mixing Methods & Texture Control</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Explore how mixing techniques influence airiness, crumb, and structure in baked goods.</p>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 2.1 — The Creaming Method</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate air for light texture</li>
        <li>Time mixing for best lift</li>
        <li>Adjust for butter temperature</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Creaming combines butter and sugar to capture air bubbles that expand during baking. Butter should be softened, not melting—around 65°F. Beat until pale and fluffy (3–5 minutes). Under-mix and you’ll get a dense crumb; over-mix and collapse as bubbles burst. Add eggs slowly to hold emulsion and achieve a fine, tender structure that defines quality cake baking.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Rest your hand lightly on the mixer; a steady hum indicates proper aeration.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake two cakes—one lightly creamed, one thoroughly—and compare crumb density and texture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 2.2 — The Muffin Method</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep wet and dry ingredients separate</li>
        <li>Mix only until combined</li>
        <li>Expect a slightly lumpy batter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Used for muffins, pancakes, and quick breads, this method avoids overmixing to preserve lightness. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in another. Add wet to dry and stir just until flour disappears. Don’t overwork—it toughens crumb by developing gluten. Rest batter 10 minutes to relax the mix and release even texture. The result: domed tops and moist interiors everyone loves.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Fold add-ins like fruit or nuts with a spatula to maintain airy texture.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Mix half a batch 20 stirs, the other 50—observe height, texture, and flavor differences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Lesson 2.3 — The Foam Method</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whip air into eggs for structure</li>
        <li>Prevent deflation when folding</li>
        <li>Control temperature for peak volume</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Foam batters like sponge or chiffon rely on whipped eggs for lift. Separate carefully—no yolk in whites. Beat until soft peaks before adding sugar slowly; shiny peaks signal readiness. Fold flour gently with sweeping motions to preserve the airy structure. Bake immediately to avoid collapse. This technique yields delicate, melt-in-your-mouth texture cherished in meringues and light cakes.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Wipe bowls with lemon juice or vinegar before beating to ensure they’re free of grease.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whip meringue manually—notice the transitions from frothy to firm to glossy soft peaks.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Module 3 -->
<section class="tool-card" id="module3">
  <h2>Module 3: Doughs & Pastry Basics</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Learn to develop, rest, and shape doughs for breads, pies, and pastries with flaky, consistent results.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.1 — Working with Yeasted Doughs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand yeast activation and fermentation</li>
      <li>Control gluten development and structure</li>
      <li>Learn proper proofing temperatures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yeast gives bread life. Activate it in warm liquid—around 105–110°F—to awaken fermentation. Combine with flour and salt to build structure through gluten, the protein web that traps gaseous CO₂. Kneading develops elasticity; resting (proofing) allows expansion. Avoid over-kneading or too hot environments—both can harm texture. Test readiness with a gentle poke that springs back slowly. The rhythm of baking bread builds intuition: temperature, timing, and touch unite science with art.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add salt only after yeast activates—it strengthens dough but can inhibit fermentation if added too soon.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake a simple loaf twice—once under-proofed, once properly proofed—compare texture and aroma.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.2 — Shortcrust & Pie Pastry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Balance fat and flour ratio for texture</li>
      <li>Prevent overworking for tenderness</li>
      <li>Master blind baking and pie assembly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shortcrust pastry thrives on simplicity: fat coats flour to limit gluten, producing a tender, flaky bite. Keep everything cold—especially butter. Mix minimally using a pastry cutter or fingertips until pea-sized crumbs form. Add just enough cold liquid to bind. Chill before rolling to relax gluten and preserve texture. For pies, blind bake crusts lined with parchment and weights to prevent puffing. The reward: crisp yet delicate layers that crumble gently—proof that patience and temperature control create perfection.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a chilled wine bottle as a makeshift rolling pin when you need even pressure and chilled contact.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Make a single- and double-crust pie using the same dough; note texture and handling differences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 3.3 — Puff & Laminated Doughs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn basic lamination for croissants and puff pastry</li>
      <li>Understand butter pliability and folding turns</li>
      <li>Maintain temperature consistency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Laminated doughs combine precision and patience. Alternate layers of butter and dough, folding and rolling repeatedly to trap steam pockets. Butter should bend—not break or melt. Each turn (book or single folds) multiplies layers exponentially. Rest dough between folds in the fridge to relax gluten. When baked, water in butter converts to steam, pushing flaky layers upward. Temperature control is the secret: too warm and butter leaks; too cold and sheets crack. Rhythm and chill make magic.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mark fold counts on parchment before chilling so you never lose track of your lamination sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Make mini puff pastries testing varied butter firmness levels—observe puff height changes.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Module 4 -->
<section class="tool-card" id="module4">
  <h2>Module 4: Flavor Balance & Sweet Science</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Understand how sweetness, salt, fat, and acid interact to enrich baked goods and create memorable outcomes.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.1 — Balancing Sweetness</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare types of sugars and syrups</li>
      <li>Use sweetness to build texture</li>
      <li>Prevent cloying flavors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sugar isn’t merely for sweetness—it influences browning, tenderness, and moisture retention. Granulated sugar creates crispness, brown sugar adds chew through molasses, honey brings moisture and subtle acidity. Replace partially, not fully, when experimenting. Learn to balance sweetness with salt, spice, or acid. Proper ratios transform a one-dimensional dessert into one with layered depth. Taste batters before baking—sweet intensity fades during baking as flavors mellow in heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> A pinch of espresso powder in chocolate recipes enhances cocoa flavor without tasting like coffee.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake two cookie batches—one all white sugar, one half brown—compare texture and color outcomes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.2 — Salt, Acid & Fat in Balance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn the chemistry of flavor enhancers</li>
      <li>Balance richness with acidity</li>
      <li>Highlight sweetness through contrast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Salt sharpens taste and deepens sweetness. Acids like citrus juice, vinegar, or cultured dairy (yogurt, buttermilk) lift heaviness and activate leaveners. Fat provides smoothness and richness—essential for mouthfeel. Harmonize them: add finishing salt atop caramel for contrast, or dash lemon into dense batters for brightness. Proper balance keeps desserts addictive instead of overwhelming. Remember, restraint is artistry. These contrasting flavors turn good bakers into flavor architects.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Sprinkle flaky sea salt on just-cooled cookies—melts slightly, giving bursts of flavor and shine.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Prepare a frosting batch with and without acid (lemon or yogurt); note brightness difference.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4.3 — The Science of Browning & Caramelization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Differentiate Maillard vs. caramel reactions</li>
      <li>Use oven placement and time for color control</li>
      <li>Recognize visual and aroma cues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Maillard reaction creates golden crusts when proteins and sugars unite under heat (~300°F). Caramelization is pure sugar transforming at slightly higher temps. Both generate deep flavor and aroma. Manage these through temperature, pH, and sugar type. Egg washes and milk help surface browning; avoid overcrowding trays, which traps steam and blocks crisping. Once understood, you can craft perfect crusts—glossy, aromatic, and evenly colored. Browning is flavor you can see.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For even browning, preheat trays so dough contacts hot metal instantly.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake shortbread at different rack levels; compare crust tone and taste.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Module 5 -->
<section class="tool-card" id="module5">
  <h2>Module 5: Decoration & Presentation</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Elevate your baked goods with beautiful finishing touches that please the eye before the first bite.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.1 — Icing, Glaze & Ganache</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Master consistency for coating and drizzling</li>
      <li>Pair icing flavor with dessert type</li>
      <li>Control cooling time and sheen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finishes define desserts. Powdered sugar glazes set quickly and add sheen; buttercream provides creamy stability; ganache gives luxury gloss. Temperature dictates texture—warm for pouring, cool for spreading. Flavor balance matters: combine citrus zest for brightness or espresso for drama. Always test consistency on parchment first. Glazing transforms home baking into professional artistry through texture and visual harmony.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add a teaspoon of corn syrup to ganache for mirror-like shine.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Decorate one cake three ways—glaze, buttercream, and ganache—to compare finish and mouthfeel.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.2 — Piping & Garnish Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use piping tips for varied shapes</li>
      <li>Control hand pressure for smooth lines</li>
      <li>Apply edible garnishes for balance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Piping requires control and confidence. Hold bags upright, twist to secure, and apply steady pressure. Practicing on parchment builds muscle memory. Balance composition—small consistent patterns are cleaner than rushed swirls. Pair textures thoughtfully: crushed nuts for crunch, citrus zest for aroma, cocoa powder for contrast. The eye eats first; decoration completes the story your dessert tells.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use one zip‑top bag with a trimmed corner for quick DIY piping.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Decorate 12 cupcakes using three consistent patterns—evaluate uniformity and appeal.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 5.3 — Plating & Serving Presentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand color contrast and composition</li>
      <li>Use negative space effectively</li>
      <li>Plate portions neatly and efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A beautifully plated dessert engages all senses. Use solid or contrasting plates to highlight colors. Sauce drizzles, powdered sugar dusting, or a dollop of cream create elegant framing. Consider balance—sweet or heavy desserts benefit from acidic fruit or crunch for contrast. Avoid overcrowding; restraint signals sophistication. Presentation conveys professionalism and pride in craftsmanship.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a fine mesh sieve nearby—light sugar dusting instantly elevates plating.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Plate the same slice of cake three ways—minimalist, rustic, and modern—and note emotional impact.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Module 6 -->
<section class="tool-card" id="module6">
  <h2>Module 6: Baking Confidence & Creativity</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Transform from recipe follower to creative baker — learn to adapt, invent, and trust your instincts.</p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.1 — Troubleshooting & Adjusting on the Fly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognize signs of over/under mixing or baking</li>
      <li>Fix texture or moisture issues mid‑process</li>
      <li>Adapt quickly using substitutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Confidence increases when you understand symptoms and fixes. Sunken centers? Oven too hot or batter overmixed. Dense texture? Overhydration or expired leavener. Learn quick adjustments: rest doughs, extend baking minutes, or mask minor texture flaws with fillings or frostings. Keep notes for patterns—baking logs turn mistakes into mastery. The key skill isn’t perfection—it’s calm correction.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep extra unbaked dough or batter reserved for tests—one small cupcake reveals doneness before a whole batch overbakes.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Bake two batches, intentionally altering oven temp ±25°F. Log differences in color, structure, and taste.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.2 — Flavor Innovation & Personal Touches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment with nontraditional ingredients</li>
      <li>Create signature flavor combinations</li>
      <li>Balance novelty with familiarity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Innovation happens when curiosity meets knowledge. Introduce new herbs, spices, or infusions—lavender, chili, matcha. Combine cultures and textures: miso caramel, citrus‑spiced bread. Write down what inspires you and taste fearlessly. Keep foundations reliable; change one element at a time to measure results. Consistency lets creativity shine. Your story begins where the recipe ends.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Warm spices bloom when toasted lightly before mixing—unlock hidden depth and aroma.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Invent a twist on a classic dessert using one locally inspired ingredient.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 6.3 — Sharing & Building Confidence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop habits to showcase and teach others</li>
      <li>Receive feedback constructively</li>
      <li>Celebrate progress, not perfection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sharing solidifies learning. Bake for others, document progress, and discuss what worked or didn’t. Feedback trains your palate and refines style. Present experiments proudly—they track evolution. Mistakes remind you how much you've learned. A confident baker enjoys both success and imperfection because each bake tells a story of practice and persistence.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep an “Idea Shelf”—a notebook or digital folder with flavor sketches and recipe tweaks for future refinement.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Host a small tasting session—invite friends to rank flavor, texture, and presentation. Use responses to iterate your next bake.</p>
