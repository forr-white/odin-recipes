    <h1>🔥 Cooking 101 – Lesson 6.3: Cooking Under Pressure & Problem Solving</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn to adapt, recover, and stay composed when things don’t go according to plan — the mindset of every confident cook.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay calm and observant during unexpected kitchen challenges</li>
      <li>Learn actionable techniques for quick problem solving</li>
      <li>Transform mistakes into opportunities for creativity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Mistakes happen to every cook — even the seasoned pros. The difference between frustration and mastery lies in reaction.
      The first rule under pressure is to stop and assess, not panic. 
      A burnt pan can become a sauce base through deglazing; an over‑salty soup can be rebalanced with acid or starch. 
      Each “disaster” hides a lesson in chemistry and patience. 
      When butter breaks in a sauce, whisk in a splash of cold water to bring it back; 
      when bread doesn’t rise, repurpose it into croutons or breadcrumbs. Every problem invites creativity if you respond with curiosity. 
      The kitchen rewards mindfulness over speed — breathe, observe, and adapt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working under time constraints also tests focus. 
      Set up your mise en place early so pressure moments aren’t compounded by clutter. 
      Trust physical cues: the scent that warns of over‑browning, the texture that signals readiness.
      Pressure reveals what knowledge has stuck — organization, flavor balance, and sequencing. 
      You’re no longer just following directions; you’re making decisions. 
      Over time, stress becomes signal, not sabotage. 
      True confidence is finding comfort in uncertainty and knowing every meal, even imperfect ones, teaches you something new.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Build a “rescue kit” on your counter — citrus, vinegar, broth, and cream. Together they can fix most common issues (too salty, too flat, too thick, or too spicy) in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Intentionally “break” a recipe this week — over‑reduce a sauce or season too heavily — then try to fix it using techniques from this lesson. 
      Document what worked and share your adjustments with peers. By learning to solve under pressure, you prove that real cooking confidence comes from resilience, not perfection.
