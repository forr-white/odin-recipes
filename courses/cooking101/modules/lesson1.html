    <h1>🍳 Cooking 101 – Lesson 1.1: Kitchen Setup & Tools</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Design your space for efficiency, flow, and joy — because great cooking begins long before the heat is on.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand why organization shapes your cooking performance</li>
      <li>Identify essential tools and when to invest in quality gear</li>
      <li>Create a clean, safe, and inspiring workspace that supports daily use</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Your kitchen is more than a collection of cupboards — it’s an ecosystem where precision, creativity, and comfort coexist. 
      The way you organize it can either streamline cooking or make it stressful. Start by evaluating how you move: chopping, washing, 
      heating, plating. Arrange accordingly — ideally clockwise from fridge → sink → prep counter → stove → serve. This circular flow 
      minimizes back‑and‑forth steps and spills. Every inch matters, especially in small spaces. Keep the tools you use daily within reach 
      on hooks or magnetic bars, and store less‑frequent items up high or in drawers. Choose durable pieces that multitask: 
      a heavy‑bottom sauté pan, chef’s knife, wooden spoon, heat‑resistant tongs, and mixing bowls in nested sizes. 
      Avoid drawers full of “someday tools.” Fewer, well‑maintained essentials outperform clutter any day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lighting and ventilation shape both comfort and safety. Bright task lighting near your prep station prevents accidents, while gentle 
      ambient lights make evening cooking relaxing. Use rugs with non‑slip backing and rubberized mats where floors get slick. 
      For storage, label dry goods, decant pantry items into clear jars, and rotate ingredients using the “first in, first out” rule. 
      Organize spices alphabetically or by cuisine for easy retrieval. The more friction you remove from your workflow, 
      the more energy you have for creativity and flavor. Even the placement of your waste bin matters — keep it close enough for scraps 
      without blocking movement. Once you stop fighting your space, cooking becomes lighter, faster, and more joyful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, consider atmosphere: play soft music, open windows, and keep a pleasant scent — citrus or herbs — circulating. 
      Your kitchen should motivate you to create, not intimidate you with disarray. When everything has a home and shines from regular care, 
      you’ll find that meal preparation turns from a chore into an act of self‑expression. 
      A cook’s confidence is built on calm repetition and readiness — the perfect pan within arm’s reach, the counter clear, 
      and your mindset steady before the flame even rises.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Do a 5‑minute “reset” after every session — wash tools, wipe counters, restock essentials. That ritual keeps inspiration alive and chaos away.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Map your kitchen workflow on paper (showing fridge, sink, prep area, and stove). Redesign the layout for a logical path from cold storage to cooked dish.
      Identify items you never use and donate or store them elsewhere. After restructuring, cook a single meal and record how many steps you walk, how often you stop to search for items, and how your stress level changes.
      Repeat the same meal a week later to see how efficiency translates into confidence and better timing.
