    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Differentiate between dry‑ and moist‑heat methods and their results</li>
      <li>Control temperature and timing for precision cooking</li>
      <li>Recognize sensory cues that signal doneness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Heat is a cook’s most powerful and misunderstood tool. It doesn’t just make food edible — it changes flavor at a molecular level. 
      Every texture and aroma begins as energy transferring from flame or coil to your ingredients. Once you understand how that transfer works, you can cook anything confidently. 
      There are two broad categories of cooking heat: dry heat and moist heat. Dry‑heat methods — grilling, roasting, pan‑searing, baking — rely on air or fat to build caramelization and crisp surfaces. 
      Moist‑heat methods — steaming, simmering, poaching, braising — use liquids to tenderize foods while keeping interiors juicy and delicate. 
      Both have a place in perfect cooking, and skill lies in knowing which suits the ingredient. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A golden crust on chicken, for instance, depends on dry heat first to brown, then gentle moist heat to finish. The goal is balance — enough high heat to develop flavor, but not so long that it burns and bitter compounds form.
      Pay attention to sight, sound, and smell. The sizzle of meat means maillard reactions are happening; the quiet change to a gentle bubble signals it’s time to lower heat.
      Cooking thermometers help, but so does intuition — practice observation until you can see doneness the way a painter sees color values.
      Remember, heat works in three ways: conduction (from pan to food), convection (hot air or liquid circulation), and radiation (grill or broiler infrared).
      Understand these forces, and you move from rule‑following to real‑time decision‑making at the stove.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learn how different materials affect outcomes — stainless steel develops fond for sauces, cast iron retains even warmth, non‑stick excels for fragile eggs.
      If you treat heat as an ingredient rather than a background element, you’ll find that mastering it changes everything: foods taste deeper, cook faster,
      and retain moisture effortlessly. Managing heat turns chaos into control — the foundation of every great kitchen.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2> 
    <p>Always preheat your pan for 2–3 minutes before adding oil. When the oil shimmers and flows smoothly, you’re at perfect searing temperature (~375°F).</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Cook the same ingredient two ways: roasted and steamed (brussels sprouts or carrots work beautifully). Compare the difference in color, taste, and aroma.
      Then combine both methods — steam to soften first, roast to caramelize after — and note how flavor layers multiply. Understanding heat is learning to compose with energy.
