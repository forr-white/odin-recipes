    <h1>🌿 Cooking 101 – Lesson 4.3: Herbs, Spices & Global Inspiration</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Discover how herbs, spices, and cultural traditions bring depth and identity to your cooking.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how herbs and spices build regional and global flavor profiles</li>
      <li>Use freshness, timing, and balance to maximize aroma and taste</li>
      <li>Develop your signature spice blend inspired by personal taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Herbs and spices are the heartbeat of global cuisine. They carry history, geography, and memory in every pinch. 
      Fresh herbs burst with oils that perfume your kitchen; dried ones concentrate intensity and warmth. 
      Knowing when to introduce them matters: hearty herbs like rosemary, bay, and thyme thrive in stews and long cooking, slowly releasing oils into fats. 
      Delicate greens like basil, parsley, cilantro, and dill should arrive late, brushing heat just long enough to bloom their aroma rather than lose it. 
      For spices, the difference between dull and dazzling often lies in technique—toast coriander, cumin, and pepper to awaken deeper notes, or bloom them in warm oil for richer color and fragrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across cultures, spice blends tell stories. Garam masala’s comforting warmth speaks of India; za’atar’s herbal tang defines the Middle East; 
      Cajun seasoning echoes Louisiana’s smoky spice. Learning these profiles teaches you ratios of heat, brightness, and body: 
      chili adds speed, coriander adds lift, cinnamon softens. Building your own mix means finding balance between backbone spices and sparks of personality. 
      Keep blends simple at first—three to five components that make sense together—then refine through repetition and memory. 
      Your goal isn’t imitation; it’s translation—connecting ingredients to your own story through flavor.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Store spices in tightly sealed glass jars away from light and heat. Crush whole spices fresh before use for maximum aroma and vibrancy in every dish.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Create a signature spice blend that reflects your tastes or heritage — start with a base (spice for warmth), a brightener (for lift), and a finisher (for aroma).
      Label the ratio and date your jar. Cook three different recipes using it and note how your blend behaves with varied ingredients — congratulations, you’ve defined your flavor identity!
