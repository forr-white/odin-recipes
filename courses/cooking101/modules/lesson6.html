    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use caramelization and Maillard reactions to deepen flavor</li>
      <li>Layer aromatics, herbs, and spices at the right stages of cooking</li>
      <li>Balance textures and timing for a complete sensory experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Building flavor is both science and art. Heat triggers reactions that transform simple ingredients into rich, complex creations.
      The first key process is the Maillard reaction — when proteins and sugars on the surface of food meet high heat, they brown and form
      hundreds of flavor compounds. Searing meat, toasting bread, or roasting vegetables uses this reaction to add depth long before seasoning.
      Caramelization — pure sugar browning — creates nutty, sweet undertones in onions, desserts, and sauces. Controlling both requires patience:
      don’t stir too soon, and avoid overcrowding pans, since food releases steam and steams instead of browns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next pillar of flavor is layering. Add ingredients in stages for dimension. Start with aromatics like onions, garlic, celery, and spices — they form your base aroma.
      Add liquid components later to capture flavorful fond (the browned bits) from the pan; that’s where sauces get their body. When adding herbs and spices, 
      separate their roles: sturdy herbs (rosemary, thyme, bay) go early for infusion; delicate ones (basil, parsley, cilantro) join near the end to preserve brightness. 
      Even temperature changes create layers — simmering blends flavors slowly, searing introduces contrast and texture. 
      Great dishes don’t rely on a single seasoning but the conversation between techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      Balancing texture seals the experience: crisp plus creamy, soft with chewy. It’s what turns a good dish into one you can’t forget.
      A sprinkle of nuts on soup or a squeeze of lemon over a buttery sauce introduces contrast and finish.
      Flavor comes not only from what you add but when you add it and how behaviors of heat and time unfold during cooking.
      The more you observe these interactions, the more you develop intuition — the sixth sense of a chef.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>When sautéing onions and garlic, wait until they smell sweet rather than sharp — that’s your cue that their natural sugars have transformed into deep savory sweetness.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Cook one ingredient (try chicken or vegetables) three ways: seared, roasted, and boiled.
      Record differences in texture, color, and flavor — note how heat type and cooking medium change the outcome.
      Then build a sauce using fond from the seared version to see how layers compound into richness that simple boiling never achieves.
