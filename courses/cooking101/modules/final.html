    <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Congratulations — you’ve completed all six modules of <strong>Cooking 101</strong>! Every small skill you’ve built has prepared you for this moment. 
      Now, it’s your turn to apply them all — the planning from Module 5, the flavor building from Module 4, and the intuition from Module 6 — to craft a complete meal that reflects your learning journey. 
      This isn’t a test; it’s a celebration of growth and creativity. 
      You’ve learned structure, but now you’ll let creativity lead.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Challenge Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan Your Menu:</strong> Design a three‑course meal (appetizer, main, dessert or any variation) that uses different techniques and ingredients covered in the course.</li>
      <li><strong>Execute with Flow:</strong> Organize your mise en place, prep all ingredients first, and time each component for seamless execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply Your Knowledge:</strong> Cook confidently using intuition — adjust flavor balances, build texture contrast, and plate with care.</li>
      <li><strong>Share & Reflect:</strong> Invite friends or family to taste. Gather feedback on presentation, flavor, and story. Document notes for future improvement.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Lesson Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Great cooking isn’t about perfection; it’s about awareness and growth. 
      Reflect on what techniques boosted your confidence most: maybe it was quick knife skills, spice layering, or mindful organization. 
      A chef never stops learning — so keep your journal handy, capture ideas from each meal, and let your signature style evolve with experience.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>Film or photograph your final challenge process — from mise en place to finished plate — to see your growth in action and build your own kitchen portfolio.</p>

    <h2>Post‑Course Challenge Extension</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you’ve mastered Cooking 101, consider documenting your own recipes for others to follow.
      Teaching what you’ve learned is the surest sign of true understanding.
      Share tips online, cook with friends, or even start a small community supper — your experience could spark someone else’s culinary journey!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Complete three‑course meal showcasing diverse skills</li>
      <li>Document planning and execution with notes/photos</li>
