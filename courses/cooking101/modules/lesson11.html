    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn why chefs season early and often rather than once at the end</li>
      <li>Understand how salt, acid, and fat interact to create depth</li>
      <li>Develop tasting habits that fine‑tune intuition and balance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Seasoning is more than adding salt — it’s the art of guiding flavor evolution throughout cooking.
      Professionals don’t wait until the end; they season in waves, building complexity and control.
      The first layer, pre‑seasoning (raw meats or vegetables before heat), allows salt to draw out moisture and enhance absorption of herbs and spices.
      Midway seasoning adjusts for evaporation and concentration — flavors intensify as liquids reduce and proteins brown.
      Finishing seasoning, added just before serving, sets contrast and texture using crunchy salts, acids, or fats like olive oil and butter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Great seasoning also relies on opposites. Salt sharpens, acid brightens, fat carries flavor, and bitterness adds structure to keep sweetness in check.
      Think of seasoning as conversation, not dictation: each addition should ask and answer — “Does this taste balanced yet?”
      Taste early and often with intention. A tiny spoon of broth can tell you exactly what a dish needs — more salt for brightness or a splash of acid for lift.
      Keep a bowl of kosher salt within reach like a painter’s palette — you should be able to feel its grain and control pinches by instinct, not measurement.
      Confidence arrives the moment you season by feel instead of fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      A chef’s secret is layering contrast: finishing salt adds pop; a drop of lemon on rich foods creates tension; fresh herbs highlight temperature and texture differences.
      There’s no single recipe for balance — only listening. Cooking is a feedback loop between your palate and your pan. Master this loop, and every dish you make tells its own story through seasoning.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>If a dish tastes flat, add a splash of acid (lemon juice or vinegar) before extra salt — acid reduces the need for excess sodium while intensifying flavor clarity.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Cook a simple dish like sautéed vegetables or pasta sauce. Season three ways — only at the end, gradually through cooking, and in layers with acids and fats.
      Taste each version side‑by‑side and record which feels richer and more balanced. The difference will teach your hands and heart how tasting informs timing.
