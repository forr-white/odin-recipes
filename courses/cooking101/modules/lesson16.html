    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop awareness of sensory cues — sight, sound, touch, aroma, and taste</li>
      <li>Trust observation and adjustment over rigid following of recipes</li>
      <li>Build muscle memory through repetition and reflection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Intuitive cooking is the evolution of everything you’ve learned so far — 
      from organization to flavor balance. It’s where technique meets trust. 
      Start by paying close attention to your senses: listen for the shift from popping sizzle to mellow crackle when onions turn translucent; 
      watch the color of butter darken from gold to amber right before nutty perfection; 
      feel texture changes under your spoon as soups thicken or sauces glaze. 
      Great cooks act on these cues instinctively because they’ve practiced paying attention. 
      Cooking is a conversation between you and your ingredients — 
      the more present you are, the more they “talk.” 
      Precision in measuring teaches consistency, but intuition teaches creativity — 
      the confidence to know when to bend a rule to make something better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trust develops through small experiments. 
      Adjust salt by micro‑tasting before serving, swap herbs to match your mood, and recognize patterns in how heat alters ingredients. 
      A tomato sauce that simmered too long last time might need extra acid this batch. 
      No two onions or stovetops behave the same — 
      seeing those differences not as mistakes but variables makes you adaptable. 
      Keep a cooking journal if it helps, recording adjustments and results to sharpen your instincts over time. 
      Soon, recipes become inspiration rather than direction, and you’ll cook from feel — precise enough to repeat, flexible enough to evolve.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>When you’re unsure of a dish’s direction, pause and smell — aroma often reveals what’s missing before taste does. Our noses detect imbalance faster than our tongues.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Choose a familiar dish (like stir‑fry or omelet). Cook it entirely without measuring — rely on visual and sensory cues only. 
      While you cook, note timing changes, aromas, and texture signals. After tasting, write down what you’d adjust next time.
      Repeat weekly until your intuition outweighs your need for a recipe. This is how true cooks find freedom in the kitchen.
