    <h1>🧼 Cooking 101 – Lesson 1.3: Kitchen Safety & Hygiene</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Safety and cleanliness aren’t chores — they’re the backbone of confident, successful cooking.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice safe cutting, heat handling, and workspace organization</li>
      <li>Prevent cross‑contamination with proper food storage and separation</li>
      <li>Build daily cleaning habits that protect health and efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      A skilled cook works with confidence, not haste. Kitchen safety begins with mindfulness — knowing where your hands,
      tools, and heat sources are at every moment. When using knives, curl your fingertips (the “claw grip”) to guide the blade safely. 
      Keep cutting boards steady with a damp towel underneath to prevent slip. Separate boards for raw protein and produce to stop cross-contamination.
      Store meat and seafood on the lowest shelf of your fridge to prevent drips onto ready-to-eat foods. Raw items in sealed containers keep fridge odors neutral and organize cleanup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respect heat: handles should always turn inward to prevent bumps; dry hands before touching
      metallic utensils or pans to avoid burns. Read recipe instructions before lighting a burner — eliminating panic means you stay aware of all hazards.
      Keep a cloth near your cooktop but never set it on the stove. Wipe oil splatters immediately to avoid slippery floors and flare-ups.
      Watch for steam burns — open pot lids away from your face. In time, these habits become instinct — so seamless you barely notice them, yet they keep you safe every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hygiene completes the circle of safety. Wash hands for at least 20 seconds before, during, and after handling different foods. Clean sponges daily and replace them often to avoid bacteria.
      Sanitize surfaces with a mix of vinegar and water or mild bleach solution after handling raw ingredients. Label and date leftovers so you never wonder if something’s “still good.”
      Check fridge temperature weekly — it should hold below 40 °F (4 °C). Cleanliness protects your ingredients, tools, and body, making each session feel more professional and pleasant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The truth is simple: a careful cook is a better cook. Every kitchen accident that doesn’t happen saves time, money, and confidence.
      Build rituals around safety rather than rules you forget — they quickly become muscle memory, part of your skill set as a chef at home.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a sink‑side spray bottle of 1 part white vinegar to 3 parts water for wiping boards and counters between tasks — it’s natural, cheap, and effective.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Write your own “Kitchen Safety Checklist.” Include five habits you want to maintain daily (knife grip, clean boards, sanitized counters, proper storage, burn protection).
      Hang it on your refrigerator and check it off each day for one week. When routine becomes automatic, you’ll know you’ve earned the title of a confident, safe home chef.
