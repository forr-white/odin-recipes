    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how batching simplifies weekday cooking</li>
      <li>Use prep systems to reduce waste and maximize time</li>
      <li>Master safe storage and quick‑reheat techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Batch cooking turns one effort into multiple meals. It’s not about monotony—it’s about efficiency and creativity. 
      The concept is simple: prepare large quantities of versatile base ingredients—like cooked grains, roasted vegetables, proteins, or sauces—that can 
      be recombined throughout the week to build different dishes. Roast chicken once, then reuse it in tacos, salads, and stir‑fries. 
      Simmer a batch of lentils or beans for quick soups and wraps. 
      Proper storage is key: divide food into labeled, airtight containers, and cool before refrigerating to preserve texture and taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smart prep complements batching. Spend two hours once a week pre‑cutting vegetables, marinating proteins, or preparing full freezer‑friendly meals. 
      Label with dates, portion sizes, and heating instructions. 
      Efficient prep isn’t rigid but responsive—rotate flavors or sauces to keep base ingredients exciting. 
      Plan your “prep day” around your schedule — Sunday for many families, or mid‑week if your work rhythm demands. 
      You’ll spend less time wondering what’s for dinner and more time actually enjoying it. 
      The true skill behind batch cooking lies not in quantity but in structure—turning repetition into rhythm.
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things fresh, mix set‑and‑forget methods like slow cookers or sheet pans with quick stovetop finishes. 
      Think of your fridge as a small buffet waiting to be remixed—combine cooked quinoa with roasted veggies and a sauce on Monday,
      roll leftovers into wraps on Wednesday, and finish the week with a hearty soup. 
      The possibilities grow when you prepare intentionally.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>Portion leftovers into single‑serve containers before chilling — this reduces temptation to over‑reheat and keeps flavors consistent throughout the week.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Choose three ingredients (such as a grain, a protein, and a vegetable). Cook and store them in bulk, then re‑imagine them into three different meals through the week. 
      Take photos of each variation. Notice how a single prep session creates freedom and variety for days ahead.
