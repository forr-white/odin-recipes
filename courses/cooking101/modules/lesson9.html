    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use timing as the invisible ingredient that ties technique and flavor together</li>
      <li>Balance contrasting textures to excite the senses</li>
      <li>Apply final touches—seasoning, garnishes, temperature—to complete your dish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Precision timing is what separates intuition from guessing. Every stage in cooking—preheat, sear, rest, plate—has a rhythm,
      and when you learn that rhythm, your dishes will taste more deliberate and professional. Most ingredients carry a “peak window”:
      vegetables lose bite if held a minute too long; proteins dry when they rest too little. Invest in a reliable timer or learn
      to count by observation— bubbles slowing, aromas changing, colors deepening. Texture, meanwhile, creates contrast. Pair crunchy
      with creamy, firm with tender. Think toasted nuts on soup, breadcrumbs over mac and cheese, or crisp greens under rich stew.
      Every good bite balances tension and relief, much like music alternating between loud and soft.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finishing touches are the punctuation marks of cooking. A sprinkle of flaky salt, drizzle of citrus or infused oil, fresh herbs, or cracked pepper
      don’t just decorate—they activate our senses at the table. Color plays its part too; vibrant greens or a splash of bright sauce create anticipation
      before the first bite. Temperature finishing matters as well: letting steaks rest five minutes redistributes juice; cooling custards
      allows texture to stabilize. Learn restraint—add only what enhances. When flavors sing loud enough, harmony needs no shouting.
      The difference between “good” and “wow” often lives in those last ten seconds before serving.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you practice, you’ll build a sixth sense for timing. You’ll know exactly when pasta is al dente, when onions turn translucent, 
      when sauces tighten, and when sugar crosses from sweet to bitter. These micro-moments define mastery. Perfect timing
      and texture come not from luck but repetition—and awareness that cooking is alive, changing every second.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>Before plating, take a breath and taste one last time — this brief pause catches over‑salting or undercooking in those final moments when adjustments still matter.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Cook one dish twice with contrasting approaches: once rushing each step and once practicing intentional pauses and texture planning. 
      Record how flavor and presentation change. Share your results and observe how timing alone elevates execution from routine to refined craft.
