    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify must‑have kitchen tools every home chef needs</li>
      <li>Practice foundational techniques — cutting, mixing, measuring, and heat control</li>
      <li>Maintain and store equipment so it performs for years</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Great cooking isn’t about expensive gear; it’s about mastering the few tools you use every day.
      Start with the holy trinity of kitchen companions: a sharp chef’s knife, a sturdy cutting board, and a heat‑balanced pan.
      Your knife should feel like an extension of your hand — balanced, not heavy. Keep it razor‑sharp using a honing steel weekly;
      a dull knife demands more force and causes slips. Practice classic cuts (dice, chiffonade, julienne) on vegetables to build
      accuracy and muscle memory. Use a stable board anchored with a damp towel to avoid movement. Next, understand the purpose of your tools:
      wooden spoons for gentle stirring, whisks for emulsions, tongs for control, and spatulas for precision. Every tool has a personality — learn what each loves to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Master technique as you familiarize with each utensil. Knife skills reduce prep time and unify cooking results;
      consistent sizes cook evenly. Mixing is more than stirring — understand motion: fold delicately to retain air or whisk vigorously to incorporate emulsions.
      Heat control is the most underrated technique: learn the difference between simmer and boil, sauté and sear.
      Touch teaches as much as sight — observe color, listen for sound, and smell flavor evolve. When you connect physically with your tools,
      kitchen tasks feel less like steps and more like rhythms. Repetition turns routine actions into instinct and care into craftsmanship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, care for your instruments. Dry knives immediately, season cast‑iron lightly, and wash stainless pots with a non‑abrasive sponge.
      Store tools logically: knives secured, handles aligned, pans stacked with protective cloths.
      A well‑kept tool saves you time and energy and shows respect for the craft. Treat your equipment like partners — maintain them, and they will never fail you.
    </p>

  <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2> 
      <p>Hold your knife where the blade and handle meet (“pinch grip”) for better balance and control — it’s the difference between cutting and carving with confidence.</p>
    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Spend 30 minutes daily practicing knife techniques with vegetables or fruit. Measure consistency by arranging your cuts side‑by‑side each day.
      Track progress for a week. As your precision improves, times will drop and confidence will rise — proof that skill comes from patience and practice.
