    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how the five basic tastes interact and balance each other</li>
      <li>Use tasting and adjustment to guide intuition while cooking</li>
      <li>Recognize imbalance and fix it using opposite taste elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Flavor is the language of food, and every dish speaks through five vowels: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami.
      Each plays a unique role in how we perceive balance. Salt enhances and amplifies; it sharpens other flavors like light brightening a photograph.
      Sweetness provides comfort and rounds edges; it’s the counterpoint to bitterness or acid. Sourness, often from vinegar or citrus, lifts heavy flavors,
      giving brightness and clarity. Bitterness adds intrigue — coffee, dark greens, and cocoa owe their complexity to its grounding pull.
      Umami, found in mushrooms, aged cheese, or soy sauce, anchors everything into depth and satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Skilled cooks embrace these elements like musical notes, layering until harmony emerges. 
      Build awareness by tasting food several times through cooking — once while raw, during simmer, and before serving.  
      When something tastes dull, it might not need salt but acidity.  
      If a sauce feels too sharp, add a touch of fat or sugar to soften.  
      Training your palate is like strength training for taste — you’ll sense imbalance faster with practice.  
      Keep a mental “toolbox” for correction: salt for brightness, acid for lift, sweetness for roundness, bitterness for structure, umami for depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond technique lies art. Think of how cultures emphasize different notes: Thai cuisine dances with sweet‑sour heat; Italian sauces rely on salty umami harmonies;
      Mexican salsas balance chili bite with lime freshness. Each tradition interprets taste differently, proving there’s no single formula — only awareness.
      By paying attention, you’ll stop following recipes mechanically and start seasoning instinctively, confidently adjusting until every bite feels alive.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>If a dish feels flat, squeeze a bit of fresh lemon or add pickle brine before more salt — acidity often creates spark without risking saltiness.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Make a simple vegetable soup and divide it into five bowls. Season each bowl to highlight one taste: a bit saltier, a touch sweet, extra sour, slightly bitter, and with added umami like soy or miso. 
      Taste each and then blend ratios until you find a perfect balance for your palate. This exercise builds awareness and fine‑tunes your flavor intuition.
