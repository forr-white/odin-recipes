    <h2>Key Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Translate your preferences into a dish that represents you</li>
      <li>Test, refine, and balance ingredients through experimentation</li>
      <li>Develop plating, storytelling, and presentation as part of expression</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson:</h2>
    <p>
      Creating your signature dish marks the moment you shift from student to storyteller. 
      This lesson is your opportunity to turn technique into personal expression. 
      Start by asking yourself: *What foods feel like home?* Flavor memories—family meals, travel dishes, or favorite spices—are your inspiration. 
      Choose one main ingredient that excites you and build around it. Consider contrasts of flavor and texture: what complements a creamy base, what cuts through richness, what introduces surprise. 
      Think beyond taste—color, aroma, and plating tell a story before the first bite.  
      Keep your first version simple; clarity reveals identity more than complexity ever will.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you’ve built your base idea, refine it through feedback and iteration. 
      Cook the dish three times, adjusting one aspect each round: seasoning balance, texture, or presentation. 
      Record your process—why an adjustment worked or didn’t—and note how repetition shapes instinct. 
      Don’t aim for perfection, aim for connection. A signature dish becomes special because it represents *you*—your influences, creativity, and care—not because it’s flawless. 
      Share it proudly, whether it’s elaborate or rustic. Signature dishes are love letters to your craft.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>Photograph each variation of your dish alongside your notes. Visual records help you track progress and spot details the palate alone might miss.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Design a dish that tells your story. Pick one primary ingredient and three supporting flavors. Cook the recipe three times, making incremental refinements.
      Present your final version to friends or family and explain the inspiration behind it. Celebrate that moment — you’ve turned knowledge into art.
