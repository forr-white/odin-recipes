    <h1>📖 Cooking 101 – Lesson 1.2: Understanding Recipes</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Learn the language of recipes so you can follow confidently, improvise smartly, and replicate success every time you cook.</p>

    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Break down recipe structure and terminology to reduce confusion</li>
      <li>Understand measurements and timing for accuracy and consistency</li>
      <li>Adapt recipes to your own preferences and ingredients on hand</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesson:</h3>
    <p>
      Recipes are roadmaps — but reading them well is a skill that transforms average cooks into confident creators.
      Each recipe is built in a logical sequence: title (what you’ll make), yield (how much), ingredients (listed in order of use),
      and instructions (numbered or grouped by action). Before you pick up a knife, scan the entire recipe from top to bottom.
      Highlight cooking verbs such as *fold, whisk, blanch, simmer* — these tell you not only what to do but also how to do it.
      The best cooks visualize the process before they start: they imagine each step and identify equipment needed so they’re never surprised mid‑recipe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurements deserve respect. Dry ingredients are measured differently from liquids — dry uses level cups or a scale; liquids use a spouted measure at eye level.
      For ultimate consistency, weigh your ingredients in grams — professional chefs and bakers swear by accuracy to avoid dense cakes or flat bread.
      Understand temperatures, too: “medium heat” on one stove changes on another. Pay attention to visual cues like “golden brown,” “fragrant,” or “until reduced by half.”
      Adjust your technique to what you see, not just what is written on paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Great recipes also evolve. Don’t fear substitution — swap broccoli for asparagus, lemon for lime, or chicken for tofu so the dish fits
      your pantry and palate. Write notes as you go; record what worked and what didn’t. Over time, your recipes become reflections of your taste and style.
      Remember: a recipe is not law; it’s a conversation between the author and you. Once you understand its language, you’ll be free to speak it fluently.
    </p>

    <p><strong>🧠 Pro Tip:</strong> Create a “recipe journal.” Print or write down favorites, add cooking times for your equipment, and note adjustments for future reference — your personal cook’s handbook grows with experience.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Choose two similar recipes for the same dish (say, chili or lemon chicken). Compare the order of steps, techniques, and seasoning levels.
      Cook one of them as written and the other with minor personal adjustments to flavors or ingredients. Document results in your recipe journal and identify which approach produced better depth and texture — you’ll start developing your own recipe instinct.
