    <ol><li>Put dried peas in a large pot and cover with about 4 inches of water. Soak the peas overnight, then drain the water and rinse.</li><li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the pork. Sear until the pork is browned onall sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the bacon, onion and garlic to the pot and cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are lightly browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, cayenne and garlic powder. Cook until the entire mixture is coated with the spices, about 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and water and drop in the bay leaves. Bring</li><li>the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes.</li><li>When the pork begins to fall apart, add the prepared peas to the pot and simmer until the peas are very soft, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours</li><li>Taste for seasonings, add some hot-pepper vinegar, if desired.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>Using the back of a spoon, smash some of the peas against the inside of the pot then stir them into the mixture. This will break up some of the peas and give them a creamier consistency. Alternatively, you can puree 1 cup of the peas and broth in a blender or a food processor, then return the puree to the pot.</li></ol>
