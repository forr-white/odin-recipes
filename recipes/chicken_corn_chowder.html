    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 strips bacon cut into small pieces</li><li>1.5 pounds chicken breast</li><li>2 tbsp butter</li><li>1 medium onion diced</li><li>2 stalks celery diced</li><li>3 garlic cloves minced</li><li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li><li>3 small potatoes diced</li><li>6 cups chicken broth</li><li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li><li>½ tsp black pepper</li><li>2 cups frozen corn</li><li>1 cup heavy cream</li><li>Herbs for garnish optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat.</li><li>Once hot, add the bacon pieces and cook, stirring frequently until just crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside.</li><li>Keep one tablespoon of the bacon grease in the pan. Season each side of the chicken breast with a pinch of salt and pepper. Brown each side of the chicken in the bacon fat for 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pot.</li><li>Add the butter to the pot. Once melted, add the onion and celery. Sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for an additional minute.</li><li>Add the flour to the veggies and sauté for one minute, stirring frequently.</li><li>Add the potatoes, chicken broth, salt, pepper, and the chicken breasts back to the pot.</li><li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently for about 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li><li>Remove the chicken from the pot and shred.</li><li>Add the cooked and shredded chicken, corn, and cream to the pot. Bring to a light simmer, stirring frequently until everything is combined and thickened. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed.</li><li>Serve with crumbled bacon and fresh herbs (optional) on top and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3><ol><li>Since the flour can’t be fermented, I sometimes like to use einkorn flour to thicken the soup because of its easier digestibility.</li><li>I love to use homemade bone broth in this recipe. It is so easy to make and is packed full of nutrients.</li><li>I use frozen corn in this recipe, since it is really convenient and easy, but you could easily substitute it with fresh corn cut from the cob.</li><li>Pan-searing the chicken seems like an unnecessary step, but I promise you, you don’t want to skip it. The searing adds so much flavor and gives the chicken a better texture.</li><li>If you want to make this soup even quicker, feel free to use pre-cooked chicken, such as store-bought rotisserie chicken or leftover chicken from another recipe.</li><li>Double this recipe to use for easy lunches for the rest of the week.</li></ol>
