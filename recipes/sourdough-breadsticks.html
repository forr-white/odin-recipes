    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sourdough starter bubbly and active</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter melted</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter melted</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried herb of choice italian blend, parsley, basil, rosemary (optional)</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="recipe-section">
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol><li>Feed sourdough starter 4-12 hours before starting the dough. It should be a bubbly starter that passes the float test.</li><li>Add all the ingredients to a bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.</li></ol><h4>Knead the dough</h4><ol><li>Knead on medium speed (KitchenAid stand mixer says not to knead over level 2) until you have a soft, smooth dough that is glossy and elastic. It can take over 10 minutes for this to be accomplished. It should past the windowpane test.</li><li>Place a lid, plastic wrap, damp tea towel, or beeswax wrap over the bowl and allow to rise at room temperature (preferably a warm place) until it doubles in size. Rising time can be anywhere from 6-12 hours depending on the temperature of your house.</li><li>Pour bread dough onto a clean and lightly flour work surface.</li><li>Divide into 12 evenly sized balls. I like to use a bench scraper to make this easy, but a sharp knife will also work.</li><li>Roll each piece of dough into a log 8” long.</li><li>Place parchment paper on a baking sheet. Carefully place the shaped breadstick dough onto the parchment.</li><li>Cover with a towel and allow to rise for 1-2 hours until puffy, about doubled in size. They can also be placed in the fridge at this point and allowed to ferment up to a day.</li><li>Bake breadsticks in a preheated oven at 400° for 20 minutes, until golden brown on top.</li><li>Meanwhile, while the breadsticks are baking, make the topping.</li><li>Combine melted butter, garlic powder, and salt.</li><li>Brush the topping on the breadsticks as soon as they are done baking and still hot. Sprinkle with herbs</li>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>This can take a long time, 10+ minutes or more with the dough hook on medium speed. Do not get discouraged if at 10 minutes it is not looking glossy and elastic. Keep kneading. It will happen.</li><li>To complete the windowpane test take a small amount of dough and stretch it between your fingers into a square. If you can see through the dough without it breaking, it is ready to go.</li></ol>
