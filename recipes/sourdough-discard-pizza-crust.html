    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1 tsp Olive oil Split in half - 1 tsp for the pan, 1 tsp for drizzling on top.</li><li>1.5 cups Sourdough discard The amount you use will depend on how big your skillet or pizza stone is. I used a 12&quot; cast iron skillet and scraped some of the starter up the sides.</li><li>pinch Italian seasoning</li><li>pinch Salt</li></ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Preheat a pizza stone, or cast iron skillet, on 425 degrees F.</li><li>When the oven is preheated, and the pans are scorching hot, take them out of the oven.</li><li>Drizzle your baking vessel (stone or skillet) of choice with a little extra virgin olive oil (about 1 teaspoon).</li><li>Ladle sourdough starter onto the hot pan, spread it out until you have a nice thin layer in the size you want.</li><li>Hit it with another drizzle of olive oil (about 1 teaspoon).</li><li>Sprinkle it with salt and Italian seasoning.</li><li>It will already start to bake when it makes contact with the pan. This is totally good and expected.</li><li>Pop it back in the oven, until crispy, and easily pulls up from the pan. About 10 minutes.</li><li>Remove the crust from the skillet (if using a skillet) and add to a baking sheet. Add your favorite sauce and toppings. Pop it back into the oven.</li><li>Bake another 8-10 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>The amount of discard you use will depend on the size of your skillet or pizza stone. The amounts above are what I used for a 12&quot; cast iron skillet.</li><li>You can use unfed sourdough starter or active and bubbly starter. Most of the time I just pull my sourdough starter right out of the fridge and use it. If you are new to sourdough, check out this post to learn how to make your own sourdough starter.</li><li>The Italian seasoning is optional, but it adds the delicious Italian flavor that we all love and come to expect on pizza.</li><li>This recipe is super simple because it utilizes sourdough starter (active or discard); the downside is you can’t use a regular pan. You must use a cast iron or pizza stone so it doesn&#039;t stick.</li><li>The secret to cooking this recipe is preheating the stone or cast iron skillet.</li><li>Chop up your veggie toppings if using while the stone or cast iron is preheating. Then sauté your veggies and/or meat while the crust is cooking, because the crust will be basically done cooking after the first bake.</li><li>There is one downside to this impossibly easy homemade sourdough pizza crust recipe. You can’t pour regular pasta/pizza sauce on it without it getting soft, even when it is nicely browned before you add the sauce.</li></ol>
