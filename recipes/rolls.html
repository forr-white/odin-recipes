    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/4 Cups Whole Milk</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup + 1 Teaspoon Sugar</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1-1/2 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Warm Water</li>
            <li>4 1/2 Teaspoon Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>5 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs, Slightly Beaten</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoon Salted Butter, Melted, For Brushing on Rolls</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the milk, 1/2 cup sugar, 5 tablespoons<br>butter and salt. Heat until mixture is Warm
            and butter is melted (it will slightly bubble<br>around the edges of the pan), remove from heat and cool to lukewarm (this is important,<br>because 
            if it's too hot, it will kill the yeast). Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the warm<br>water, 1 teaspoon of sugar and yeast. Allow to sit for 5
            to 10 minutes or until bubbly and frothy.<br>If the yeast mixture does not get bubbly and frothy, start yeast mixture over.</li>
            <li>Add 3 cups of flour to the bowl of your stand mixer. Pour warm milk mixture into the bowl<br>and mix, using the dough hook, until combined, scraping
            sides of bowl with a rubber spadula as<br>needed. Add the yeast mixture and beaten eggs and mix until combined. Gradually add<br>remaining two cups
            of flour, 1/2 cup at a time, or until dough starts to pull away from the sides<br>of the bowl as you mix. Dough should still be slightly sticky to the 
            touch. Don't add too much<br>flour or your rolls will be dry. You may or may not need the entire 5 cups of flour</li>
            <li>Cover bowl with a towel and allow dough to rise until doubled in size. When Dough has risen,<br>
            punch down. Form dough into balls (if it's a little too sticky, spray hads with cooking spray)<br>
            Place on a large greased sheet pan, pacing 2-3 inches apart. Cover with a towel and allow to rise<br> for one hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake for 12-13 minutes. Tent rolls with foil the last few<br> minutes of baking. The rolls brown pretty quickly,
            so tenting them with foil is a must. When<br>done baking, brush with remaining 2 Tablespoons of melted butter. Makes around 16 large rolls.</li>
        </ol>
