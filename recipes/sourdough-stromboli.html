    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>With a fed, active starter, add all dough ingredients to a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchy and passes the windowpane test.</li><li>Cover and let the dough rise for about 10-12 hours in a warm place.</li><li>After the bulk rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, melt the butter and mix in garlic powder and parsley. Set aside.</li><li>On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 14” x 12”, dusting with flour if needed. Brush the surface of the dough with some of the garlic butter.</li><li>Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the dough, reserving about two inches of space on the sides and one inch on the top and bottom. Finish the filling by layering all of the meats across the center of the dough on top of the cheese.</li><li>Starting with a long edge of the dough, begin folding it over the filling. Continue rolling until the dough is completely rolled up. Tuck the dough on the top and the bottom of the stromboli to secure both ends. Pinch well to shut. At this point, you can opt to wrap the stromboli and refrigerate for up to 12-15 hours as a make-ahead option.</li><li>Carefully place stromboli on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, keeping the seam side down. Brush with more of the garlic butter. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden.</li><li>Remove from the oven and brush with the remaining garlic butter. Let cool for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with a dusting of grated parmesan if you&#039;d like, then enjoy!</li></ol>
