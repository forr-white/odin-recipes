    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Rinse the poblanos and roast them in the oven at 400F. Give them a flip after 15 minutes. They&#039;ll be mostly roasted in another 10-15 minutes, so 25-30 minutes total roasting time in the oven.</li><li>Add 3 tablespoons butter to a saucepan on medium heat.  Roughly chop an onion and add it to the saucepan, cooking for 5-7 minutes or until softened.  Mince 4 garlic cloves and add to the onion, cooking for a minute or so.</li><li>Add 3 tablespoons flour to the onion mixture and combine well.  Add 4 cups of stock along with 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano (optional), a pinch of cumin (optional), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and freshly cracked black pepper. Stir well.  Simmer for 7-8 minutes.</li><li>Once the poblano peppers have cooled a bit, pull off as much skin as you can but don&#039;t worry about getting rid of all of it. Then de-stem and de-seed the poblanos. Roughly chop the poblano pieces and add them to the saucepan.</li><li>Cook until everything is at a uniform temp and then combine the mixture in a blender. Be sure to use caution when blending hot liquids -- I usually just hold a paper towel over any openings just in case you get a geyser.</li><li>Return mixture to the saucepan and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Salt to taste. I added another 1/4 teaspoon of salt but keep in mind the salt level will depend on which stock you use.</li><li>Serve immediately but don&#039;t forget to garnish! I used Crema, finely chopped cilantro stems, freshly ground pepper, and a couple dashes of Valentina hot sauce.</li><li>The acidity of the hot sauce pairs well with the poblanos so feel free to re-garnish once you make your way through the top layer. Other options for acidity: lemon/lime juice or vinegars.</li><li>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>This soup is spicy!  If you want a milder version I would recommend roasting all of the poblanos but only adding half or two-thirds of them to the pan to start with.  Once blended, take a taste and if you want more heat simply add more poblano.</li><li>I used homemade chicken stock with this recipe. Store-bought stock typically has a higher sodium level so adjust accordingly.</li><li>I used Valentina hot sauce to add a hint of acidity, but there are lots of options for this: lemon/lime juice, vinegars, or your choice of hot sauce.</li><li>I tried this recipe with cream mixed into the soup but didn&#039;t like it as much. I preferred it when the cream was used as a garnish.</li></ol>
