    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>2 large russet potatoes, scrubbed and cleaned</li><li>½ cup neutral oil, avocado, coconut, or olive oil</li><li>Salt</li></ul>
  </section>

  <section class="recipe-section">
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Cut the potatoes into small bite-sized pieces, about ½” thick. Once all the potatoes are cut, use a clean towel to pat the potato pieces completely dry. You don’t want the potatoes to have any excess moisture.</li><li>Heat a 10 – 12 inch cast iron skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Let the pan and oil heat up for about 3 – 5 minutes. Place a piece of potato into the skillet and if it starts sizzling it’s ready.</li><li>Working in batches, add a handful of the cut potatoes into the hot skillet. Spread evenly so they all have space to cook. Do not overcrowd the skillet with too many potatoes.</li><li>Cook for about 7 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for another 3 – 4 minutes or until the second side is golden brown and the potato is tender.</li><li>Remove the crispy potatoes from the pan and place onto a paper towel lined plate or baking sheet to drain the excess oil, and immediately hit with a pinch of salt.</li><li>Repeat with the remaining potatoes. This may be about 3 – 4 batches.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>Don’t overcrowd the pan with too many potatoes. If you do it will create steam and not get a crispy potato.</li><li>Do not cover the pan with a lid as this creates steam.</li><li>Keep the potatoes about ½” thick (not too small, but not too large) so that they will cook up crispy.</li></ol>
