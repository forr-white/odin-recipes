    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Make The Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, add the sourdough starter, water and olive oil. Mix with a fork to combine. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing with your fork until the dough becomes stiff. Then squish everything together with your hands to incorporate all of the four. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, if preferred.</li>
    <li>After the dough has rested: return to the bowl and work the dough into a rough ball, about 15 seconds.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Bulk Rise:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Now the dough needs to rise. Cover the bowl with lightly oiled plastic wrap (alternatively, transfer the dough to a high-sided dough tub with lid and measuring marks). Let rest in a warm spot to rise, ideally 70-75 F. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has almost doubled in size.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Stretch &amp; Fold The Dough:</h4>
  <ol>
<li>During bulk rise, you have the option to perform a series of ‘stretch &amp; folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30-45 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about 1 hour apart. Although this step is not mandatory, it will increase the total volume and height of your bread. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Cut &amp; Shape The Dough:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping).</li>
    <li>Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf.</li>
    <li>To shape: use a bench knife to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle.</li>
    <li>Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Second Rise:</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time.</li>
  <li>Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside of the pot for a “free form” second rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cover with the lid of the pot. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size.</li>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Score The Dough:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, razor blade, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Bake The Dough:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures.</li>
<li>You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C.</li>
<li>Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing. Don’t cut too soon or else the inside will have a gummy texture!</li>
</ol>
