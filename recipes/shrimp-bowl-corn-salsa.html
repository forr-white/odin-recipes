    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Preheat the Grill and Prepare the Shrimp</h4>
    Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. Grilling shrimp is quick,<br>
    so it's essential to have everything ready to go before you start cooking.<br>
    <br>
    In a large bowl, toss the peeled and deveined shrimp with olive oil, paprika,<br>
    garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Make sure<br>
    all the shrimp are evenly coated with the seasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 2: Grill the Shrimp</h4>
    Place the seasoned shrimp on the grill, making sure they’re not<br>
    overcrowded. Grill the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they<br>
    turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them, as shrimp can<br>
    become tough when grilled for too long.<br>
    <br>
    Once the shrimp are grilled to perfection, remove them from the heat<br>
    and set them aside.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 3: Prepare the Corn Salsa</h4>
    While the shrimp is grilling, prepare the corn salsa. In a medium-sized bowl,<br>
    combine the thawed corn, diced red onion, chopped cilantro, minced<br>
    jalapeño (if using), and freshly squeezed lime juice. Add salt to taste, and<br>
    stir everything together until well combined. The salsa adds a sweet and<br>
    tangy element to the bowl, balancing the richness of the shrimp and<br>
    avocado.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 4: Make the Creamy Garlic Sauce</h4>
    In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cilantro, lemon<br>
    juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Stir until the sauce is smooth<br>
    and well-blended. This creamy garlic sauce will provide a tangy, savory<br>
    finish to the dish, bringing all the flavors together in harmony.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 5: Assemble the Grilled Shrimp Bowl</h4>
    Now it’s time to assemble your bowl! Start with a base of sliced or mashed<br>
    avocado. The creamy avocado will serve as a delicious foundation for the<br>
    grilled shrimp and corn salsa.<br>
    <br>
    Next, arrange the grilled shrimp on top of the avocado. Follow with a<br>
    generous spoonful of the corn salsa, ensuring it’s evenly spread across the<br>
    shrimp. Drizzle the creamy garlic sauce over the top, making sure each bite<br>
    gets a little of that flavorful sauce.<br>
    <br>
    To finish, garnish the bowl with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.<br>
    These garnishes not only add a touch of flavor but also a nice visual<br>
    contrast to the vibrant colors in the dish.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy!</h4>
    Your Grilled Shrimp Bowl is now ready to be served! This dish is perfect as a<br>
    light lunch or dinner, and it can be easily customized based on your<br>
    preferences. Whether you’re serving it for a weeknight meal or impressing<br>
    guests at a barbecue, this dish is sure to be a hit.<br>
