    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Preheat the Grill and Prepare the Shrimp</h4>
    Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. Grilling shrimp is quick,
    so it's essential to have everything ready to go before you start cooking.<br>
    <br>
    In a large bowl, toss the peeled and deveined shrimp with olive oil, paprika,
    garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Make sure
    all the shrimp are evenly coated with the seasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 2: Grill the Shrimp</h4>
    Place the seasoned shrimp on the grill, making sure they’re not
    overcrowded. Grill the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they
    turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them, as shrimp can
    become tough when grilled for too long.<br>
    <br>
    Once the shrimp are grilled to perfection, remove them from the heat
    and set them aside.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 3: Prepare the Corn Salsa</h4>
    While the shrimp is grilling, prepare the corn salsa. In a medium-sized bowl,
    combine the thawed corn, diced red onion, chopped cilantro, minced
    jalapeño (if using), and freshly squeezed lime juice. Add salt to taste, and
    stir everything together until well combined. The salsa adds a sweet and
    tangy element to the bowl, balancing the richness of the shrimp and
    avocado.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 4: Make the Creamy Garlic Sauce</h4>
    In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cilantro, lemon
    juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Stir until the sauce is smooth
    and well-blended. This creamy garlic sauce will provide a tangy, savory
    finish to the dish, bringing all the flavors together in harmony.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 5: Assemble the Grilled Shrimp Bowl</h4>
    Now it’s time to assemble your bowl! Start with a base of sliced or mashed
    avocado. The creamy avocado will serve as a delicious foundation for the
    grilled shrimp and corn salsa.<br>
    <br>
    Next, arrange the grilled shrimp on top of the avocado. Follow with a
    generous spoonful of the corn salsa, ensuring it’s evenly spread across the
    shrimp. Drizzle the creamy garlic sauce over the top, making sure each bite
    gets a little of that flavorful sauce.<br>
    <br>
    To finish, garnish the bowl with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.
    These garnishes not only add a touch of flavor but also a nice visual
    contrast to the vibrant colors in the dish.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy!</h4>
    Your Grilled Shrimp Bowl is now ready to be served! This dish is perfect as a
    light lunch or dinner, and it can be easily customized based on your
    preferences. Whether you’re serving it for a weeknight meal or impressing
    guests at a barbecue, this dish is sure to be a hit.<br>
