    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1⅔ cups vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 (1 ounce) envelopes ranch dressing mix</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (16.5 ounce) package saltine crackers</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="recipe-section">
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix the seasoning oil:</strong>
        Add the vegetable oil, ranch dressing mix, crushed red pepper flakes,
        garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper to a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine well:</strong>
        Seal the bag and squeeze/massage with your hands until the oil and spices
        are fully combined and no clumps of seasoning remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the crackers:</strong>
        Place the crackers into the bag, seal, and gently turn and rotate the bag
        to coat all the crackers in the seasoned oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Let the flavor soak in:</strong>
        Let the bag sit for about 1 hour, then turn and rotate again. Repeat several
        times until the crackers are evenly coated. Allow the bag to sit 8 hours or
        overnight so the crackers fully absorb the seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong>
        Remove the crackers from the bag and serve as a snack, appetizer, or party mix.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <section class="recipe-section notes">
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Letting the crackers sit overnight gives the best flavor and crunch — the oil fully absorbs and the heat mellows into the perfect kick.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a milder version, reduce the crushed red pepper flakes to 1–2 tablespoons.</li>
    <li>For extra heat, add ½–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper or use spicy ranch seasoning.</li>
    <li>Use regular saltines if you want a lighter texture; multigrain adds a heartier crunch.</li>
    <li>Flip or rotate the bag several times during soaking to ensure every cracker gets evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container for up to one week — the flavor continues to develop over time.</li>
    <li>These make great party snacks, holiday gifts, or additions to charcuterie boards.</li>
