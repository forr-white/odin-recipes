    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>In a liquid measuring cup add warm water (should be warm to touch. If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast), honey, and active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes. The yeasts should activate and get nice and bubbly.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer bowl with a dough hook attachment, add the sourdough starter discard, 1/4 cup olive oil, water/yeast mixture and salt.</li><li>Mix together on low speed (setting 2 for KitchenAid). Add the flour a half cup at a time until it starts pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10-15 minutes or more with a stand mixer. It should pass the windowpane test.</li><li>Place dough in an oiled bowl with a lid, damp towel, or cover with plastic wrap.</li><li>Let the dough rest for 1-2 hour in a warm spot. Should double in size.</li><li>Put 1/4 cup olive oil in the bottom of the 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper.</li><li>Place dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li><li>Press the focaccia dough out to the edges. If the dough is really sticky, dip fingers in a bit of olive oil and then spread out the dough.</li><li>Using your fingers, press the top of the dough down, creating dimples in the dough.</li><li>Cover and let the dough rise for 1-2 more hours.</li><li>Add a drizzle of olive oil to the top (1-2 tablespoons) and sprinkle with garlic powder and chopped rosemary.</li><li>Bake at 400 for 20 minutes until golden brown.</li><li>Allow to cool, and enjoy.</li></ol>
