    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Mango-Peach</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a blender, puree all the ingredients until completely smooth and no chunks remain, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture in 2 and pour onto the prepared baking sheets. Spread the mixture to an 1/8″ thick even layer.  It is REALLY important to make sure the mix is all in one even layer. To help with this, I found topping the pan against the count a few times really helpful. Place in oven and bake for 6-8 hours, until center is not tacky anymore.  Remove from oven and allow to cool before cutting.</li>
    <li>Cut into strips and roll um up! Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks or freeze.</li>
