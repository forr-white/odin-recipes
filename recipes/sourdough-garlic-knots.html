  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1 ¼ cup whole milk</li>
<li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>½ cup sourdough starter active and bubbly</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3 ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>minced parsley to garnish - optional</li>
<li>grated parmesan to garnish - optional</li>
<li>flaky salt to garnish - optional</li>
<li>½ cup salted butter melted and cooled</li>
<li>1 tablespoon freshly minced garlic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add the milk, honey, sourdough starter, butter, salt, and flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Knead on medium for about five minutes, or until the dough is smooth and glossy.</li>
<li>Place the dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a tea towel or plastic wrap, then let rise in a warm area for about eight hours or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Make the garlic butter by melting the butter in a small bowl. Add minced garlic and stir. Set aside.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle until it’s about ¼ -½ “ thick.</li>
<li>Spread a spoonful or two of the garlic butter over the dough with a pastry brush, then cut into 18 rectangular pieces. I aim for equal pieces, but they don't have to be perfect.</li>
<li>Form each piece into a knot by twisting each rectangle and then tying into a knot. Tuck the ends underneath. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
<li>Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for another 1-2 hours until puffy and nearly doubled. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit about halfway through the rise.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 12-15 minutes or until lightly golden.</li>
<li>Immediately brush more of the garlic butter over the top, followed by freshly chopped parsley. If you plan to add parmesan, go ahead and grate it over the top now, followed by a pinch of flaky sea salt. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Please double check amounts when using the multiplying feature in the recipe card. </li>
<li>If you are looking for gram measurements, toggle to the “metric” version in the recipe card.</li>
<li>Make sure your starter is active before beginning the recipe. </li>
<li>Over-proofing can cause your dough to collapse, so just proof until doubled.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven while your knots are on their second rise, ensuring a nice hot bake right from the start.</li>
    </ol>
