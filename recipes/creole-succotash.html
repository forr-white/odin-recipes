        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 (28oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh or frozen okra, trimmed and cut crosswise into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh or frozen lima beans</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh or frozen corn kernels</li>
        <li>1 pound smoked pork sausage, cut crosswise into 3/4 inch slices</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless smoked ham, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Pinch of dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 cup water, if needed</li>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>Hot cooked rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the<br>tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, and celery and stir to coat well in the fat. Cook, uncovered,<br>stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in the okra, lima beans, corn, sausage, ham, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, still uncovered,<br>until vegetables are soft, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. If the mixture seems dry toward the<br>end of the cooking time, stir in water to moisten, a little at a time, then cover the pan and<br>continue cooking.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shrimp. Cook, stirring often, until the shrimp are cooked<br>through and the flavors have blended, about 15 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Mound<br>the rice on large plates, poon the succotash over rice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
