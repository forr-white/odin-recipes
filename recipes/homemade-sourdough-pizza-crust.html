  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>1/2 cup starter</li>
<li>4 cups flour</li>
<li>1.5 cups water</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The morning of pizza night, add the ingredients to a stand mixer bowl.</li>
<li>With a dough hook, mix the dough on medium speed until the dough passes the windowpane test, which might take up to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Place in an oiled bowl and cover with a lid or plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature for about 8 hours.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 475.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 equal sections and allow to rest while you prepare your toppings.</li>
<li>Roll out on a lightly floured surface. I like to create a bit of a ridge around the outside for hand stretched thickness.</li>
<li>Spread pizza sauce and top with your favorite toppings.</li>
<li>Bake for 13-15 minutes (I like to use a preheated pizza stone or cast iron skillet but you can also use a pizza pan.). Finish off with a 3 minute broil to achieve the browning on top of the crust.</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Active starter is sourdough starter that has been fed within 4-12 hours, and itâ€™s active and bubbly. You want to use starter that is at the peak of its bubbling in order to give the dough the most rise.</li>
<li>Be careful not to over-ferment the dough. This will leave you with a sloppy mess. </li>
<li>This dough can be made days or even weeks in advance. If you are planning to use it within a few days, place in the fridge in an airtight container until ready to use. You can also freeze for later.</li>
<li>Make sure that your dough is at room temperature before rolling. The correct dough temperature allows the dough to relax, and makes it easier to shape and roll.</li>
    </ol>
