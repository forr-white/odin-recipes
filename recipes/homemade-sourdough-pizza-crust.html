    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1/2 cup starter</li><li>4 cups flour</li><li>1.5 cups water</li><li>2 teaspoons salt</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li></ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>The morning of pizza night, add the ingredients to a stand mixer bowl.</li><li>With a dough hook, mix the dough on medium speed until the dough passes the windowpane test, which might take up to 10 minutes.</li><li>Place in an oiled bowl and cover with a lid or plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature for about 8 hours.</li><li>Preheat oven to 475.</li><li>Divide the dough into 4 equal sections and allow to rest while you prepare your toppings.</li><li>Roll out on a lightly floured surface. I like to create a bit of a ridge around the outside for hand stretched thickness.</li><li>Spread pizza sauce and top with your favorite toppings.</li><li>Bake for 13-15 minutes (I like to use a preheated pizza stone or cast iron skillet but you can also use a pizza pan.). Finish off with a 3 minute broil to achieve the browning on top of the crust.</li></ol>

  <section class="recipe-section notes">
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>Active starter is sourdough starter that has been fed within 4-12 hours, and it’s active and bubbly. You want to use starter that is at the peak of its bubbling in order to give the dough the most rise.</li><li>Be careful not to over-ferment the dough. This will leave you with a sloppy mess.</li><li>This dough can be made days or even weeks in advance. If you are planning to use it within a few days, place in the fridge in an airtight container until ready to use. You can also freeze for later.</li><li>Make sure that your dough is at room temperature before rolling. The correct dough temperature allows the dough to relax, and makes it easier to shape and roll.</li></ol>
