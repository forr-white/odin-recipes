    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just bubbling around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir in sugar and 4 tablespoons butter; let cool, stirring occasionally, until mixture is between 110 degrees F and 120 degrees F (43 degrees C and 48 degrees C) about 10 minutes. Stir in yeast; let stand until mixture is foamy, about 10 minutes.</li><li>Add salt, egg yolk, 1 egg, and 1/2 of the flour; beat on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Still on low speed, carefully add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and beat until dough just comes together, about 1 minute. Dough will be very sticky and wet. Increase speed to medium, and beat until dough pulls away from sides of bowl and dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.</li><li>Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; transfer dough to prepared bowl. Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place until about doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li><li>With a clean hand, punch down dough and turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press or roll dough out into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Trim edges with a sharp knife to create a perfect 16- x 8-inch rectangle. Starting at one long end, fold dough in half to form a 16- x 4-inch rectangle; pinch to close dough halves together.</li><li>Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2-inch) squares. Place dough squares onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; set aside at room temperature until about doubled in size, 1 hour. (It’s okay if the baking sheet looks a little crowded.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li><li>Whisk together remaining egg and water until combined. Brush tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 16 minutes.</li><li>Microwave remaining 2 tablespoons butter on HIGH until melted, about 30 seconds. Immediately brush rolls with melted butter.</li><li>Serve warm with <a href="https://cookanythingkitchen.com/recipes/copycat-texas-roadhouse-butter.html">Cinnamon Honey Butter.</a></li></ol>
