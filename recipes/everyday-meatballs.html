  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 pound ground meat (I use a mix of beef and pork)</li><li>2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs or 1/2 cup panko</li><li>1/3 cup milk or water</li><li>2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</li><li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan or Romano cheese (optional)</li><li>2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt, divided</li><li>Pinches of red pepper flakes or few grinds of black pepper</li><li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>2 garlic cloves, minced, divided</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 28-ounce can of tomato puree or crushed tomatoes</li></ul></section>
  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Directions</h2><ol><li>Place meat, crumbs, milk or water, parsley, cheese (if using), 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, onion powder, eggs and half</li><li>of your minced garlic in a large bowl. I like to mix all of this together with a fork, which does a good job of breaking up</li><li>the eggs and chunks of meat. Form mixture into 1 1/2 to 2-inch meatballs and arrange on a plate. I like to let them</li><li>set in the fridge for a bit — 30 minutes, if you can spare it — which helps them keep their shape.</li><li>In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and some pepper flakes and let</li><li>sizzle until garlic is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!) and season with remaining</li><li>salt. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes (with a thicker puree) or 20 (for crushed tomatoes,</li><li>which are usually more watery), stirring occasionally.</li><li>With stove on the lowest heat possible to maintain a gentle simmer, add meatballs to sauce one by one, and cover</li><li>with a lid. It will be hard but please don’t touch or move them for at least 20 minutes of the 25-minute cooking time,</li><li>so that they have a chance to keep their shape. Meatballs should be fully cooked through at 25 minutes, but it</li><li>cannot hurt to cut one in half to verify.</li></ol></section>
  <section class="recipe-section notes"><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Eat however makes you happy:</li><li>— as-is.</li><li>— with spaghetti: I’ll cook it very al dente, a generous minute shy of done, reserve a little pasta water, then once the</li><li>spaghetti is drained, place it back in the pot with a splash of the water and a ladle or two of the sauce beneath the</li><li>meatballs and cook it together over high heat for a minute. Tip spaghetti into a large, wide bowl, add the meatballs</li><li>on top. Note: If your family likes a lot of sauce with their spaghetti, you might consider making the meatballs with an</li><li>extra half or whole can. Just use what you need.</li><li>— “parmesan”-ed: Place meatballs in a shallow baking dish with some of their sauce. Tear about 8 ounces</li><li>mozzarella over the top and broil until melted. Finish with some parmesan, if desired, some breadcrumbs fried in a</li><li>little olive oil and/or chopped parsley</li></ul></section>
