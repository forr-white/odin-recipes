    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1/4 cup sugar 48 g</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt 8 g</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Feed your starter the night before. You want it to be active and bubbly in the morning.</li><li>The following morning, add all ingredients to your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Knead at medium speed until the dough becomes smooth and glossy, which may take 10-15 minutes (or more). This is a very wet, sticky dough, but you don&#039;t need to add more flour.</li><li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, a lid, or a damp towel and begin the first rise in a warm place for 6-8 hours or until doubled. Enriched doughs tend to take longer to rise than regular doughs.</li><li>Transfer dough to a work surface (if it&#039;s still sticky, add a touch of flour) and divide into 16 equal pieces. A bench scraper is great for this. Roll each piece of dough into a ball using the counter for tension.</li><li>Place rolls on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rise until doubled again. This may take between one and four hours based on the temperature of your kitchen.</li><li>While the rolls finish their second rise, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Brush the tops of the rolls with an egg wash (one large egg yolk whisked with one tablespoon of water) and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden. Cool for a few minutes before serving.</li></ol>

  <section class="recipe-section notes">
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>This dough is very wet but will be manageable after kneading and rising. No additional flour is needed, as too much flour will make the rolls a bit tougher and less light and fluffy.</li><li>I highly recommend a stand mixer as the best way for kneading this sticky, wet dough.</li><li>If you don’t have bread flour, you can use all-purpose. The texture won&#039;t be quite as light, but they&#039;ll still be delicious.</li><li>For a quicker second rise, set your rolls in a warm location, such as on top of the oven, on a counter over a running dishwasher, or in a warm pantry.</li></ol>
