    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cups unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li><a href="../recipes/royal-icing.html">Royal Icing</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl using a hand or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter<br>
            and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the<br>
            egg, vanilla, and almond extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape<br>
            down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be<br>
            relatively soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more tablespoon of flour.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment<br>
            paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly foured rolling pin, roll the dough out<br>
            to about 1/4 inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled out dough<br>
            can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust one of the rolled out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. Place the<br>
            second rolled out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at<br>
            least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or<br>
            silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it's sticking<br>
            to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into<br>
            shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd peice of<br>
            dough.</li>
        <li>Arrange cookies on baking sheet 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned<br>
            around the edges.</li>
        <li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling</li>
        <li>Enjoy cookies immediately or wait until the icing sets to serve.</li>
    </ol>
