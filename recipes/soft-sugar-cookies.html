    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li><li>In a large bowl using a hand or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.</li><li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be relatively soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more tablespoon of flour.</li><li>Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly foured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4 inch thick.</li><li>Lightly dust one of the rolled out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. Place the second rolled out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.</li><li>Once chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it&#039;s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd peice of dough.</li><li>Arrange cookies on baking sheet 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges.</li><li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling before adding icing.</li><li>Enjoy cookies immediately or wait until the icing sets to serve.</li></ol>
