    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter
            <li>1 cup diced yellow onion
            <li>1 cup matchstick carrots
            <li>1 cup diced celery
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
            <li>1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk, or half and half
            <li>1 (32 oz) quart chicken stock
            <li>4 cups shredded cooked chicken
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, optional
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste
            <li>salt, to taste
        </ul>
    <h4>Homemade Dumplings</h4>
        <uL>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour
            <li>1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon, baking powder
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
            <li>1 teaspoon salt
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, optional
            <li>¾ cup (6 oz) whole milk
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted
        </uL>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large heavy bottomed pot like a dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high<br>heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5 minutes, until vegetables being<br>to soften. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
            <li>Add flour and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Slowly<br>add the evaporated milk and chicken stock, stirring to combine. You are making a<br>roux to thicken the soup and make it creamy. It's very important to keep stirring to<br>prevent burning or lumps!
            <li>Bring to a boil and add the chicken, thyme, black pepper and salt. Lower the<br>heat and let the soup simmer, uncovered, while you make the dumplings.
        </ol>
    <h4>Dumplings</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized bowl, whisk to combine the flour, baking powder, pepper, salt<br>and thyme. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour the milk and<br>butter into the center of it. 
            <li>Using a wooden spoon (or rubber spatula), stir together until a dough ball forms.<br>If your dough seems too dry, you can add an extra tablespoon of milk. 
            <li>Using a medium sized cookie scoop, scoop dough and drop directly into the<br>simmering soup. Place them around the pot, not all in the same place. Once all<br>dumplings have been added, gently press them down so the soup runs over just the<br>tops of them. You can also use two spoons to scoop the dumplings, using one spoon<br>to scoop and the other to push the dough into the pot. Try to keep the dough balls<br>the same size for even cooking.
            <li>Place the lid on your pot and lower the heat to a low simmer. You don’t want the<br>bottom of the soup to burn, but want the soup to still be simmering (a low bubble)<br>to cook the dumplings. 
            <li>Cook dumplings for 15 minutes with the pot lid on. Gently stir the soup/dumplings<br>and cut one dumpling in half to make sure they are cooked through. About half way<br>through the cook time, I will usually open the lid once and press the dumplings<br>back under the broth. I will also break up any dumplings that may be sticking<br>together.
            <li>If the dumplings are cooked through, serve hot! If not, cook an additional 3 to 4<br>minutes and check again.
