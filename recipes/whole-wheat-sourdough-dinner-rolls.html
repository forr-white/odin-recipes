    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Add all the ingredients (except the egg for the egg wash) to the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment and begin mixing on medium speed for 5 minutes. The dough should become very elastic and smooth. Check gluten development with the windowpane test.</li><li>Place the dough in a large, greased bowl and cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise overnight (8-24 hours) at room temperature until nearly doubled.</li><li>The next day, divide the dough into eight equal pieces (a scale is helpful). Shape into balls creating tension on against a countertop. Place rolls on a lightly oiled or parchment paper-lined baking dish.</li><li>Cover the rolls and rise at room temperature until doubled, approximately one to two hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.</li><li>Prepare an egg wash by whisking one egg with one tablespoon of water. Brush the tops of the rolls.</li><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake the rolls for about 25-30 minutes or until they start turning golden brown. Allow to cool a bit before serving.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>The starter must be recently fed, active, and visibly bubbly to use in this recipe.</li><li>Use melted, slightly cooled butter so you don&#039;t harm the starter with high temperatures. Your water also should be warm, not hot.</li><li>If you do not have a stand mixer, you can knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for ten minutes.</li><li>A kitchen scale helps achieve consistent sizing with your rolls, which will help with a more even bake.</li></ol>
