    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3.5 lbs. Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
        <li>3.5 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons salted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the half and half and sour cream to a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set it aside and<br>
            allow it to come to room temperature. It shouldn't be cold when added to the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Peel each potato and give them a quick rinse to remove any dirt/residue from the peel. Cut into<br>
            3 even slices and place in a large pot. Add cold water until they're all submerged.</li>
        <li>Slowly bring to a gentle boil, do not boil rapidly. This ensures the potatoes cook evenly and<br>
            prevents them from falling apart. Once a soft boil is reached, add 3.5 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Cook for 25 minutes or until the potatoes are very fork tender, don't undercook or they'll be<br>
            lumpy when mashed. Turn heat off</li>
        <li>Drain all of the water. Let them sit in the warm pot for 5 minutes to allow most of the steam<br>
            to escape.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the potatoes and allow it to gradually melt.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 3/4 of the half and half mixtureover the mashed potatoes. Mash with a potato masher,<br>
            until soft and creamy. Don't overmash or the consistency will become gluey. Add remaining dairy<br>
            only if a slightly creamier texture is desired.</li>
        <li>Taste the potatoes and add more salt/pepper if needed.Transfer to a serving dish and serve.</li>
