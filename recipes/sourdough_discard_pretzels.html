    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 teaspoons active dry yeast 9g</li>
      <li>1 cup water 236 g</li>
      <li>1 cup sourdough discard 285 grams</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey 42 g</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt 14 g</li>
      <li>4 cups unbleached all purpose flour 560 g</li>
      <h4>For boiling the pretzels</h4>
      <li>2 quarts water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <h4>Egg Wash</h4>
      <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. It should get nice and bubbly.</li><li>To the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, add the sourdough discard, honey, salt and flour. </li><li>Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5-10 minutes.</li><li>Place the dough in a large mixing bowl that has been lightly greased. </li><li>Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, a beeswax wrap, plastic wrap, or a wet tea towel.</li><li>Let the dough rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li><li>Divide the dough into 15 equal pieces.</li><li>Roll each piece into a 18” rope and then create a U-shape.</li><li>Take the two ends of the rope and create a twist with the dough.</li><li>Twist it twice and then press the ends of the dough into the bottom of the U-shape. Make sure to pinch the dough together well to prevent the dough from unraveling during the boiling process.</li><li>Cover with a tea towel and let the dough rest in a warm place for 30 minutes to one hour, or until puffy.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li><li>Bring water in a large stockpot to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.</li><li>Add the pretzels to the boiling water and boil for 30 seconds on each side, being careful not to overcrowd.</li><li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the pretzels and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.</li><li>Brush each pretzel with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt or pretzel salt. </li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.</li><li>Another option is to bake and then once they are done baking, brush with melted butter and dip in cinnamon sugar. Yum.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3><ol><li>Make sure when shaping the pretzels, to pinch the dough together well. If it isn't, the dough may come apart during boiling.</li><li>Sensitive to baking soda? You can substitute the baking soda for just brown sugar. It will still give you that yummy chewy skin that pretzels are known for.</li><li>Depending on the hydration of your starter, it could make the pretzel dough more or less stiff. I use a starter that has been fed equal parts flour and water. If you feed your starter something different, then the amount of flour may need to be adjusted.</li></ol>
