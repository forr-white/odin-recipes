    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>Have your ingredients in place before you begin to cook. Look for black and green cardamom pods, Kashmiri chile powder, and 4 to 5 inch long green chiles at Indian or Pakistani markets. If you cannot find Kashmiri chile powder, toast and grind one large guajillo chile and use 2 teaspoons, if a long green chile is unavailable, substitute a serrano. For a milder keema, omit the fresh chile or only use half of it. Serve with rote, naan, or basmati rice.</li></ol>
