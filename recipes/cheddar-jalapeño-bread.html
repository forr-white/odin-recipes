  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 tsp. instant yeast (less than a ¼-oz. package)</li><li>4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li><li>1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more</li><li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li><li>3 medium jalapeños, finely chopped</li><li>6 oz. extra-sharp cheddar, coarsely grated (about 1½ cups)</li><li>2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup plus 1 Tbsp.)</li><li>1 large egg</li></ul></section>
  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Directions</h2><ol><li>Stir together 1 tsp. instant yeast (less than a ¼-oz. package) and 1 Tbsp. warm water (105–115°F) in a small bowl; let mixture stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If it doesn&#039;t foam, discard and start over with new yeast.)</li><li>Beat 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, yeast mixture, and 1¾ cups warm water (105-115°F) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook on low speed until a soft dough forms. Scrape down sides of bowl, then increase speed to medium-high and beat 3 minutes more. Mix in 3 medium jalapeños, finely chopped, all but one big pinch of 6 oz. extra-sharp cheddar, coarsely grated, and all but one big pinch of 2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated, and beat until combined.</li><li>Scrape down sides of bowl, gathering dough ball into center, then sprinkle top of the dough lightly with flour. Cover mixing bowl with a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) to keep a crust from forming and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1–1½ hours. (Alternatively, let dough rise in bowl in refrigerator 8–12 hours.)</li><li>Turn dough onto a very well-floured surface and gently form into a roughly 11x8&quot; rectangle with floured hands (dough will be sticky).</li><li>Fold dough in thirds (like a letter) with floured hands, pressing along seam of each fold to seal.</li><li>Put dough, seam side down, in an oiled 9x5&quot; loaf pan. Cover pan with same kitchen towel and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until dough completely fills pan and rises above it slightly, 45 minutes–1 hour.</li><li>Halfway through rise time, place oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F.</li><li>In a small bowl, beat 1 large egg with 1 pinch kosher salt. Brush loaf with egg, then sprinkle reserved cheddar and Parmesan down center of loaf.</li><li>Bake until bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, 50 minutes—1 hour. Let cool slightly so it’s easier to handle. Run a knife around edge of pan to loosen loaf, then tip bread out from pan onto a sheet pan lined with a wire rack; arrange loaf on its side.</li><li>Return bread to oven for 10 minutes to crisp the sides and bottom of the crust. Remove from the oven and set jalapeño cheddar bread upright. Let cool completely on rack before slicing, about 1½ hours.</li></ol></section>
