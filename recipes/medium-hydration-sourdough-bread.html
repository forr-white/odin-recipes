  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>900g Bread flour</li><li>100g Whole wheat flour</li><li>750g Water</li><li>200g Active sourdough starter (100% hydration)</li><li>20g Salt</li></ul></section>
  <section class="recipe-section"><h2>Directions</h2><ol><li>Autolyse: Combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, and 700 grams of the water in a large bowl. Mix by hand or spoon until no dry flour remains, then cover and rest for 30 to 60 minutes.</li><li>Add Starter and Salt: Add 200 grams of active starter to the dough and mix until fully incorporated. Sprinkle in 20 grams of salt and pour in the remaining 50 grams of water. Squeeze and fold the dough until the salt and water are evenly absorbed and the dough feels cohesive.</li><li>Bulk Fermentation (4–6 hrs): Keep the dough at around 78°F (26°C). During the first two hours, perform three to four sets of stretch and folds every 30 minutes to build strength. Allow the dough to rise by about 50 to 75 percent in volume, with a slightly domed surface and visible bubbles.</li><li>Pre-Shape &amp; Bench Rest: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pre-shape it into a round and let it rest uncovered for 20 minutes to relax the gluten.</li><li>Final Shape: Shape the dough into a boule or batard and place it seam-side up in a floured banneton or towel-lined bowl to maintain its structure.</li><li>Cold Proof: Cover the dough and refrigerate it for 12 to 18 hours to allow slow fermentation and flavor development.</li><li>Bake: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) with a Dutch oven inside. When ready, remove the dough from the fridge, score it with a sharp blade, and carefully place it into the hot Dutch oven. Bake for 20 minutes covered, then uncover and continue baking for another 25 to 30 minutes until the crust is deeply golden brown. Allow the loaf to cool for at least one hour before slicing to set the crumb.</li></ol></section>
  <section class="recipe-section notes"><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>For slightly softer crust: bake 10 minutes less uncovered.</li><li>For extra open crumb: extend autolyse to 90 minutes and perform coil folds instead of stretch/fold.</li><li>For stronger sour flavor: proof longer or use a less-fed starter (slightly tangy).</li></ul></section>
