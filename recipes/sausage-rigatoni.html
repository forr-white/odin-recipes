<h1>Rigatoni with Sausage, Tomatoes, and Zucchini</h1>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 lb rigatoni pasta</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    <li>1 lb Italian sausage (mild, sweet, or spicy)</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cups grape tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup white wine or chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 small zucchini, diced</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>    
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add oil to a large, wide pot and brig to a simmer over medium heat. Add in the onion and crushed red pepper 
        and cook until the onion is very soft, about 10 minutes. Add in the sausage, using a wooden spoon, break it into small pieces.
        Cook until sausage is brown and no pink color remains.</li>
    <li>Add in the garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Stir in the tomato paste.</li>
    <li>Add in the tomatoes and wine (or stock) and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to burst
        and give off their juices, about 10 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to gently press the tomatoes if they're not bursting on their own. 
        Stir in the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, add the rigatoni into the boiling water and cook for 9 to 10 minutes, or until al dente.</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta, reserving a 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Toss the pasta immediately into the pot with the sauce and stir well to combine. 
        Add in some of the reserved cooking water, if needed. Finally, stir in the basil.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, divide among serving bowl, top with cheese, and serve at once. Enjoy!</li>
