    <h1>Black Eyed Peas with Bacon and Pork</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb dried black-eyed peas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 oz pork shoulder, diced into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>4 strips thick bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>hot pepper vinegar, as desired</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put dried peas in a large pot and cover with about 4 inches of water. Soak the peas<br>
                overnight, then drain the water and rinse.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the pork.<br>
                Sear until the pork is browned onall sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the bacon, onion and garlic to<br>
                the pot and cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are lightly browned, about 6 to 8 minutes.<br>
                Add the salt, black pepper, cayenne and garlic powder. Cook until the entire mixture is coated<br>
                with the spices, about 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and water and drop in the bay leaves. Bring<br>
                the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the pork begins to fall apart, add the prepared peas to the pot and simmer until the peas<br>
                are very soft, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours</li>
            <li>Taste for seasonings, add some hot-pepper vinegar, if desired. Discard the bay leaves and transfer<br>
                the black eyed peas to a serving bowl.</li>
        </ol>
    <h1>NOTE:</h1>
            <h3>Using the back of a spoon, smash some of the peas against the inside of the pot then<br>
            stir them into the mixture. This will break up some of the peas and give them a creamier<br>
            consistency. Alternatively, you can puree 1 cup of the peas and broth in a blender or a<br>
            food processor, then return the puree to the pot.</h3>
