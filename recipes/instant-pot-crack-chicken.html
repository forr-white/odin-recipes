    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep. Press the "Saute" button on the instant pot and wait for it to heat up.</li>
            <li>Cook the bacon. Add the diced bacon and cook for a minute or two or to a desired crispness. Remove from the Instant Pot and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Brown the chicken. Heat the oil in the Instant Pot. Season the chicken breasts with paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Once olive oil is hot, add the chicken breasts and brown on both sides; about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Season the cream cheese. In the meantime, place the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and season it with garlic powder, onion powder, dried dill weed, dried chives, salt, and pepper; mix to combine.<br>Or you can also season the cream cheese with 1 tablespoon of store-bought Ranch Seasoning Mix.</li>
            <li>Combine. On the Instant Pot, press "Cancel" to stop saut√©ing. Add the cream cheese mixture to the Instant Pot. Pour in the chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Cook. Set the pot on High Pressure for 12 minutes; then do a quick release.</li>
            <li>Shred the chicken. Remove the chicken and transfer it to a cutting board to shred it with two forks or meat shredder claws.</li>
            <li>Mix it all together. Stir the shredded chicken back into the Instant Pot; place the lid back on the Instant Pot (powered off) and let stand for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve. Top the crack chicken with previously prepared bacon, fresh parsley, and scallions and serve it in sandwiches, over pasta or rice, in lettuce wraps, as a dip, etc.</li>
