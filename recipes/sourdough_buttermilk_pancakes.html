    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <h4>Night before:</h4>
      <li>1/4 cup sourdough starter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups unbleached all purpose flour</li>
      <h4>Next day:</h4>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter melted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <h4>For frying:</h4>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The night before, mix together sourdough starter, buttermilk, and flour in a large bowl. Let the batter ferment at room temperature covered with a lid.</li><li>The next morning, heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li><li>To the sourdough buttermilk mixture, add the eggs, melted butter, honey, salt, and baking soda. Whisk together well.</li><li>Add butter to the skillet.</li><li>Pour 1/3 cup of pancake batter onto the hot skillet. Add chocolate chips or different add-ins to the pancake batter. I like to add them now, rather than to the batter, because they stick less.</li><li>Cook until all the bubbles have popped and no more bubbles are forming.</li><li>Flip and cook for a minute or two more minutes or until cooked through and golden brown.</li><li>Transfer to a plate and top with whipped cream, berries, and maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3><ol><li>Although I like to make an overnight batter to give the flour time to ferment, you can also just make this recipe into quick sourdough pancakes by mixing them up in the morning.</li><li>To know if pancakes are ready to flip, watch the bubbles. Once the bubbles have stopped popping and making new bubbles it is ready to flip.</li><li>When adding blueberries and chocolate chips, I like to place them on the uncooked side while the pancakes are cooking. I find that if you add them to the batter before cooking they tend to stick to the cast iron griddle. If you add them while cooking, they donâ€™t stick.</li><li>I love adding cinnamon or pumpkin spice to this recipe for a fall twist.</li></ol>
