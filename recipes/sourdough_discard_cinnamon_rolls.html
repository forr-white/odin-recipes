    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 teaspoons baking soda</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 cup sourdough discard</li><li>1 cup water</li><li>1/2 cup butter melted</li><li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <h4>Cinnamon Sugar Filling</h4><li>1/2 cup butter softened</li><li>1 cup brown sugar</li><li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
      <h4>Cream Cheese Topping:</h4><li>6 ounces cream cheese</li><li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li><li>1/2 cup honey, maple syrup also works great</li><li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter and set aside to cool.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, then go ahead and prepare your cast iron skillet or baking dish by lightly brushing it with butter or oil.</li>
      <li>To a large bowl, add all of the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Combine.</li>
      <li>Now add the wet ingredients: sourdough discard, water, melted (and cooled) butter, and honey.</li>
      <li>Mix together until a ball forms. This may take about three to five minutes.</li>
      <li>Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface, then roll with a rolling pin, working it into a rectangle shape that is about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
    </ol>
      <h4>Make the filling:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, add the softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon, stirring until the ingredients come together.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling evenly over the top of the dough with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Starting at the long side of the rectangle, begin rolling the dough up tightly. When fully rolled up, press the edge closed to keep the filling in.</li>
        <li>Slice evenly into rolls. You can use a sharp knife, unflavored dental floss, or even thread. The floss or thread are helpful because they can cut through the dough in a sawing motion without smashing the dough down like a knife tends to do. Try to keep the sizes as consistent as possible. You should end up with around 12 rolls.</li>
        <li>Place the rolls into your prepared skillet or dish, spaced just a touch apart for even baking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-35 minutes or until the rolls are a light golden brown and the dough is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Let the rolls cool for a bit before frosting, as the frosting will just slide off the hot rolls.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Add cream cheese, heavy cream, maple syrup or honey, and vanilla extract to a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Stir until combined over medium heat.</li>
        <li>You can use an immersion blender to get an extra smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour over the warm cinnamon rolls, then serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To long-ferment this recipe, withhold the leavening agents in the beginning. Let the dough rise overnight, and add the baking soda and powder the following day, kneading well before forming the rolls.</li>
      <li>For best results, aim for consistency when cutting the rolls. Smaller rolls will bake more quickly than larger ones, leaving some rolls overbaked and others potentially underbaked. </li>
      <li>When rolling up the dough, a bench scraper can be helpful to help ease the dough away from the work surface if it sticks.</li>
      <li>The thinner you roll out your dough, the more layers of cinnamon filling you'll end up with.</li>
      <li>Rolls placed more closely together will yield a softer exterior, while rolls placed farther apart will have a firmer crust. Rolls placed apart will also keep their round shape better, whereas they are often square when placed close together or touching.</li>
      <li>While you could use active starter rather than discard, discard will have a deeper flavor because it is long-fermented.</li>
    </ol>
