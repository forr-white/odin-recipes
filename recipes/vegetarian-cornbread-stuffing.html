    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the cornbread:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan or cast-iron skillet with butter or oil.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined.</li>
      <li>Create a small well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the milk, vegetable oil, and egg. Whisk gently until just combined; a few small lumps are okay.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cornbread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely.</li>
      <li><strong>Dry the cornbread:</strong> Once cooled, cut the cornbread into 1-inch cubes. Spread the cubes on a baking sheet and bake at 300°F (150°C) for 15–20 minutes, stirring once, until the edges feel dry but not hard. Let cool. (This step can be done a day ahead.)</li>
      <li><strong>Prep the oven for stuffing:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li><strong>Sauté the vegetables:</strong> In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the diced onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, 8–10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic, sage, thyme, parsley, black pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook for 1–2 minutes more, until fragrant. Remove from the heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine the stuffing:</strong> Place the dried cornbread cubes in a large mixing bowl. Add the sautéed vegetables and any optional add-ins (mushrooms, pecans, cranberries, squash). Toss gently to combine.</li>
      <li>Drizzle 1½ cups of vegetable broth evenly over the mixture, tossing gently so the cornbread absorbs the liquid without turning mushy. Add more broth a little at a time if the mixture still feels dry. Taste and adjust seasoning with extra salt or pepper as needed.</li>
      <li>Whisk the eggs in a small bowl, then pour over the cornbread mixture and gently fold to combine, trying not to break up the cubes too much.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it into an even layer. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for 10–15 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden and the stuffing is set in the center.</li>
      <li>Let the stuffing rest for 5–10 minutes before serving so it can firm up slightly and slice or scoop more cleanly.</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="recipe-section notes">
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Vegan option:</strong> Use olive oil instead of butter and replace the eggs with 2–3 tablespoons ground flaxseed mixed with 6 tablespoons water (let sit 5–10 minutes to thicken).</li>
      <li><strong>Make ahead:</strong> Cornbread can be baked and cooled up to 2 days in advance, then cubed and dried. You can assemble the stuffing up to the point before baking, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Add a splash of extra broth before baking if it looks dry.</li>
      <li><strong>Texture control:</strong> Add broth gradually. The cornbread should be moist and just starting to clump together, not soggy. If it looks overly wet, bake uncovered a bit longer to dry the top.</li>
      <li><strong>Flavor variations:</strong> Try adding finely chopped fresh sage, rosemary, or thyme, or folding in roasted vegetables like butternut squash or Brussels sprouts for extra flavor and color.</li>
