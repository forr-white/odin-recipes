    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Rinse 1 pound of dried lima beans and place them in a large bowl. Cover with water and soak overnight. Drain and set aside.</li><li>In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon oil. Sauté 1 diced onion for 3–5 minutes until softened. Add 2 cloves minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 2 smoked turkey wings, 6 cups of water (or broth), ½ teaspoon onion powder, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes until the meat starts to fall off the bone.</li><li>Stir in the soaked and drained lima beans. Simmer uncovered for 1½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and creamy. Add more water as needed to keep beans covered.</li><li>Once the beans are tender and the broth has thickened, pull the meat from the turkey wings and stir it back into the pot. Taste and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil or butter for richness, if desired. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li><li>Spoon into bowls and enjoy with warm cornbread or over white rice. Enjoy!</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>No time to soak? Use the quick-soak method: cover beans with water, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let them soak for 1 hour.</li><li>Prefer a thicker broth? Smash a few beans against the side of the pot toward the end of cooking.</li><li>Make it vegetarian by skipping the smoked meat and adding smoked paprika or liquid smoke.</li><li>Spice it up with a pinch of cayenne pepper or a chopped jalapeño.</li><li>Swap the meat – Smoked ham hocks, neck bones, or andouille sausage also work great.</li></ol>
