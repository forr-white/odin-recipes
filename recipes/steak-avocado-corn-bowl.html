    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Marinate the Steak:</strong> In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the flank steak. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Preheat the Grill or Skillet:</strong> If you’re using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat. If you’re using a skillet, heat it over medium-high heat and add a splash of olive oil.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook the Steak:</strong> Once the grill or skillet is hot, place the marinated flank steak on it. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until it reaches your desired doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check; 130°F is medium-rare, while 145°F is medium.</li>
      <li><strong>Rest the Steak:</strong> After cooking, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for about 10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy steak.</li>
      <li><strong>Slice the Steak:</strong> Once rested, slice the steak against the grain into thin strips. This will help keep the meat tender and easy to chew.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook the Corn:</strong> If you’re using fresh corn, you can grill it alongside the steak for added flavor. Simply husk the corn and grill it for about 10 minutes, turning occasionally until charred. If using frozen corn, sauté it in a skillet with a little olive oil for about 5-7 minutes until heated through. For canned corn, simply drain and rinse.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> While the corn is cooking, chop the cherry tomatoes in half and dice the red onion. Set these aside in a bowl.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Avocados:</strong> Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh out with a spoon. Slice the avocado into thin pieces or cubes, depending on your preference. Drizzle a little lime juice over the avocado to prevent browning.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Base:</strong> In a large bowl or individual serving bowls, start with a base of cooked quinoa or brown rice. This will provide a hearty foundation for your bowl.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> Begin layering the ingredients on top of the quinoa or rice. Start with the sliced steak, followed by the corn, cherry tomatoes, diced red onion, and avocado.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Lime Juice:</strong> Squeeze fresh lime juice over the entire bowl for a zesty kick. This not only adds flavor but also brightens up the dish.</li>
      <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Sprinkle chopped fresh cilantro over the top for a burst of freshness. If you like a little heat, drizzle some hot sauce or add a spoonful of salsa on top.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> This bowl is best enjoyed fresh. Serve it immediately while the steak is warm and the vegetables are crisp.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customize Your Bowl:</strong> Feel free to customize your bowl with additional toppings like shredded cheese, black beans, or even a dollop of Greek yogurt for creaminess.</li>
      <li><strong>Store Leftovers:</strong> If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The components can be kept separately to maintain freshness, especially the avocado, which can brown quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Choosing the Right Steak:</strong> Flank steak is great for this recipe due to its flavor and tenderness when cooked properly. However, you can also use skirt steak or sirloin if you prefer.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooking the Corn:</strong> If you want to add a smoky flavor, consider grilling the corn for a charred taste.</li>
