    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Add active sourdough starter, room temperature water, honey, salt and flour to the bowl of a stand mixer</li><li>Mix the dough on low speed for 10-15 minutes with the dough hook. You could also knead by hand. The dough should pass the window-pane test.</li><li>Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm place for 8-12 hours.</li><li>Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.</li><li>Roll each piece into about 15” rope.</li><li>Cut into equal portions and place on a baking sheet with parchment paper</li><li>Cover the dough and allow them to rise for about an hour.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li><li>Bring water in a large stockpot to a boil and add baking soda and brown sugar.</li><li>Place a few pretzel bites at a time into the boiling water and allow to boil for 15-20 seconds. I like to do 8 pretzel bites at a time. You don&#039;t want to overcrowd them.</li><li>Remove with a slotted spoon or kitchen spider strainer, shaking off excess water and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.Brush egg wash onto each pretzel bite (optional) and sprinkle with coarse salt.</li><li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>The dough should pass the window-pane test. Take a small amount of dough and stretch it between your fingers. If you can stretch it to the point where it’s thin enough to see through, then it is ready.</li><li>Use an active sourdough starter so the dough will rise well.</li><li>This is the perfect master recipe that is delicious with just a little salt or you can totally customize with additional delicious toppings.</li><li>Sourdough discard may be able to be used if you let the dough ferment much longer.</li></ol>
