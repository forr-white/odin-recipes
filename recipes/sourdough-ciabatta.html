    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1 cup bubbly and active sourdough starter 227 grams</li><li>2 cups water 472 grams</li><li>1 tablespoon salt 17 grams</li><li>4 ½ cups bread flour 630 grams</li></ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><li>Feed sourdough starter 4-12 hours before starting the sourdough ciabatta dough.</li><li>Gently combine the starter, water, salt and flour in a large mixing bowl. Allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes to autolyse.</li><li>Perform three series of stretch and folds each 30 minutes apart. (Make sure to cover the bowl with plastic wrap, foil, or a damp tea towel in between so the dough doesn’t dry out.)</li><li>To do this, first stretch the dough up about 6 -12 inches on one side, and then push it in to the center of the dough. Turn the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat the process, turn a quarter turn, repeat the stretch and fold.</li><li>Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, and allow it to rise until doubled. The time this takes will depend on the temperature of your house and how active your starter is. For me, this usually takes about 4 hours.</li><li>Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and allow it to ferment for 12-24 hours.</li><li>The next day, slide the dough out of the bowl and onto a floured work surface. Be careful not to deflate the bubbles.</li><li>Gently shape the dough into a rectangular shape, and dust the top with flour.</li><li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces by cutting it down the middle lengthwise and then making three cuts on each side.</li><li>Use the bench scraper to gently transfer the rolls to parchment paper.</li><li>Cover with a tea towel and allow to rise 1-2 hours.</li><li>Preheat pizza stone at 475 and put a cast iron skillet on the bottom rack.</li><li>Add a bit of water to the cast iron skillet on the bottom rack for steam (this helps the crust to develop a golden color and give it an extra-crusty crust).</li><li>Slide the loaves onto the pizza stone (with the parchment paper) or a large baking sheet, and place into the hot oven.</li><li>Bake for 25 minutes or until the crust is golden.</li><li>Move to a cooling rack to cool.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol><li>If you struggle with gluten sensitivity, try fermenting the dough for at least 12 hours. The longer fermentation time allows the wild yeast to break down the gluten more. Also, I would suggest dusting the top with einkorn flour during the last step before baking. Einkorn is much easier to digest than regular wheat.</li></ol>
