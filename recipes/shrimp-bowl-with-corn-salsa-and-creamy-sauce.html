    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Preheat the Grill and Prepare the Shrimp:</h4> Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. Grilling shrimp is quick, so it's essential to have everything ready to go before you start cooking. In a large bowl, toss the peeled and deveined shrimp with olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Make sure all the shrimp are evenly coated with the seasoning.</li>
        <li><h4>Grill the Shrimp:</h4> Place the seasoned shrimp on the grill, making sure they’re not overcrowded. Grill the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them, as shrimp can become tough when grilled for too long.</li>
        <li><h4>Prepare the Corn Salsa:</h4> While the shrimp is grilling, prepare the corn salsa. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the thawed corn, diced red onion, chopped cilantro, minced jalapeño (if using), and freshly squeezed lime juice. Add salt to taste, and stir everything together until well combined. The salsa adds a sweet and tangy element to the bowl, balancing the richness of the shrimp and avocado.</li>
        <li><h4>Make the Creamy Garlic Sauce:</h4> In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cilantro, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Stir until the sauce is smooth and well-blended. This creamy garlic sauce will provide a tangy, savory finish to the dish, bringing all the flavors together in harmony.</li>
        <li><h4>Assemble the Grilled Shrimp Bowl:</h4> Now it’s time to assemble your bowl! Start with a base of sliced or mashed avocado. The creamy avocado will serve as a delicious foundation for the grilled shrimp and corn salsa. Next, arrange the grilled shrimp on top of the avocado. Follow with a generous spoonful of the corn salsa, ensuring it’s evenly spread across the shrimp. Drizzle the creamy garlic sauce over the top, making sure each bite gets a little of that flavorful sauce. To finish, garnish the bowl with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. These garnishes not only add a touch of flavor but also a nice visual contrast to the vibrant colors in the dish.</li>
        <li><h4>Serve and Enjoy:</h4> Your Grilled Shrimp Bowl is now ready to be served! This dish is perfect as a light lunch or dinner, and it can be easily customized based on your preferences. Whether you’re serving it for a weeknight meal or impressing guests at a barbecue, this dish is sure to be a hit.</li>
